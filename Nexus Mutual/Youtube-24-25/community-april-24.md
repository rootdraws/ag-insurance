[Music] welcome everybody to this week's
0:08
bi-weekly Community call we hold our community calls every other week on Tuesday at 11:00 a.m. eastern and 3pm
0:16
UTC today we have Brave and Hugh with us on the call today h is joining in from
0:22
the Nexus Mutual main account and we'll start off with a discussion of the state
Agenda
0:28
of defi in year SKS and risk and then Brave will review the new listings on
0:34
the UI we have quite a few new protocol cover listings and um also a lot of
0:41
bundled protocol cover listings we'll go over them briefly and then we will
0:46
review the new cover by UI which is um which is a really nice Improvement to
0:53
the UI it's quite fast and you can see your covers in a in a much neat way you
1:00
also get notifications when your cover is expiring Bray will um talk all about
1:05
that and then we'll review um the latest updates from our
1:11
governance and Hugh will share his updates from the foundation and um we'll we'll have the
1:19
chance to answer any open questions in the end and I'll share more details on
1:24
how to receive this disc calls po app in the end as well okay okay um let's get things
1:31
started how is the state of Def Brave yeah good morning everybody um
BraveNewDeFi's State of DeFi Yields Report
1:38
yeah let's talk a little bit about the state of defi yields and risk I'm still traveling this week so I'm a bit behind
1:43
on my state of defi yield report but I'm hoping to have that out later this evening there's quite a lot to cover in
1:49
this week's issue so I find that each issue is getting a little bit longer but there's just a lot happening in defi
1:55
right now but uh here's an early preview for those of you on the call today um looking at uh the market on a whole the
2:02
def5 base rate has remained largely the same since last week's issue with the bottom end of the base rate dropping
2:07
down near 10% top end is still up in the mid 30% range um the top 7-Day yield
2:14
opportunities on Vol FYI show a range of somewhere between 10 and 34% with
2:19
gearbox v3s passive earn markets at the top of the leaderboard um gearbox v3's
2:25
uh earn opportunities are primarily on ethereum but gearbox is Al expanded on to optimism and arrum one at this point
2:33
as well so they're getting on a few more l2s which is nice letting Market yields have come down since last week uh
2:40
gearbox V3 is the outlier of course with yields ranging from 29 to 34% however
2:46
the rest of the lending markets uh range between 9 and 133% at 133% figure is
2:51
important since that's the Benchmark rate that maker Dows by savings rate provides at the moment but speaking of
2:57
the DSR there's a proposal on the maker form to adjust stability fees for maker vaults the borrow rate in the spark
3:03
lending market and the interest rate for the DSR The Proposal that's currently on the maker Forum outlines a 3% reduction
3:10
across the board for all of these markets which would mark down the DSR rate from 133% to 10% the block
3:17
analytical labs uh report that they shared um provided their Outlook and their rationale for the changes in the
3:23
maker Forum I'll share a brief quote from that the latest Dynamic suggests that highly bullish sentiment subsided
3:29
in of Uncertain geopolitics and the macro environment among other factors
3:35
the relative demand for long leverage decreased in recent weeks resulting in a drop in borrowing and funding rates in
3:40
various onchain and CI crypto markets um so you can look on the maker
3:47
forum for a little bit more explanation there but I think in the next week or so once the next maker Dow executive vote
3:52
goes through the DSR will drop to 10% um this analysis matches the drop
3:57
I've seen funding R across D and C5 for Bitcoin eth and um some of the other
4:03
Majors um Bitcoin and eth are in the 4 to 12% range annualized for funding rates there are some defi protocols like
4:09
synthetics and dydx where funding rates are actually negative and Traders are getting paid to open shorts so um demand
4:15
for generalized Leverage is down which is why we've seen a drop in interest rates across lending markets uh A's
4:22
outstanding debt as a reflection has dropped from 4.84 billion last week to
4:27
4.54 billion this week looking at the yield environments there's still quite a few yield
4:33
opportunities on protocols we have listed on Nexus Mutual gearbox B3 like I talked about their lending Market um is
4:39
still providing High apy since demand to farm Ena from Athena and liquid reaking
4:45
token points is still very high uh the main net market for gearbox um for usdc
4:51
is around 18 and a half% go is at 19% D is around 24% usdt is 22% and the
4:59
rates for eth are about 16.5% um there are some lower yield opportunities on l2s but primarily the
5:07
yields for cbx are on mainnet yields on the FX USD curve LP pairs on convex
5:13
Finance are quite high as well so the go FX USD pair is around 51% variable APR
5:21
the frax FX USD pair is around 42 and a half uh variable APR and the curve View
5:29
USD FX USD pair is about 30 and a half variable APR the pendal yields are quite
5:36
high for liquid Rec token holders interested in selling their yield and points a few examples are the ethery
5:43
principal token and the Renzo easy eth token um principal token both of these
5:48
have longer dated maturities now uh which are active for the next 246 days
5:53
and the EFI principal token offers around 25% fixed apy for that time frame
5:59
the Renzo Easy E apy is around 30% for that same time frame so these longer
6:06
dated maturities are going to be kind of a boom for people that want to lock in a rate for a longer period of time um
6:13
there are some other ones as well there are some that are on mainnet and arbitrum I'll have more detail and a
6:19
wider breakdown on those in the newsletter so for more information just keep an eye on the next issue which
6:24
should be published later today I've also created a channel on farcaster for defy yield
6:30
um but that's where I'll share my reports and where I'll share different yield opportunities that I'll highlight from that newsletter as well on the risk
6:37
side we seeing more hacks in recent months um immuni latest crypto losses report for q1 noted losses of 300 and uh
6:47
21.6 billion related to protocol hacks notable recent hacks that I've seen the
6:52
Prisma F hack uh which is a fork of liquidy they suffered a loss of 11.6
6:58
million due to vulnerability in the mitigate mitigate or migrate Trove zap contract um that contract was
7:06
designed to migrate positions across tropes there was uh a missing check on there which led to an exploit hedgy
7:13
Finance suffered a loss of 44.7 million after their uh besting smart contracts
7:18
were exploited and then we've seen some other Forks that have either been exploited or they've upgraded parameters
7:25
because they're controlled by a multi-sig which resulted in loss for users it's a good reminder that you should be very careful when using
7:31
protocol Forks you can usually find this information on defy llama but if you have any questions about protocols you're looking at just drop in the next
7:37
we with Discord and we can provide some information there as well um and if there's a protocol you'd like to see listed so you can buy cover and scree
7:44
out in Discord or through our contact form um you can also just send me a message on Twitter or Discord but just a
7:50
reminder to be careful out there sometimes when the Market's not you forget about the risks that are present
7:56
for uh smart contract risk so um just keep that in mind when you're looking and if you have questions just reach out
8:02
to us on Discord but uh I know I've covered a lot um but I'm going to go
8:07
over to the new protocol covered listings if anybody has any questions in the meantime just feel to inter uh just feel free to interrupt me um in the last
New Cover Listings
8:15
couple of weeks we've added more Pendle bundle covers for request for members so you'll find the Renzo zerc Pendle bundle
8:22
the kelp Dow zeret Pendle bundle and the ethery zor Pendle bundle um you can find
8:28
these in the NEX with UI these specific bundles protect against smart contract
8:33
risk across igen layer um the specific liquid be staking token protocol Pendle
8:38
and then the zerin state contract on map we've had like I said a lot of requests for this so we've added this we've also
8:44
added Arcadia protocol cover um Arcadia is a yield optimization protocol on base
8:52
that is recently launched so those are the prim primarily the new listings um just an FYI will be on a new listing
8:59
Hiatus for the next week or so but if there is a new listing you would like the product un team to review please
9:05
reach out to us on Discord or send us a message with the contact form and the next gr to a website again you can DM me
9:10
on Twitter or Discord and request a listing and I'll make sure that gets reviewed during the next meeting um and
New Buy Cover Flow
9:16
if you've seen the new listings in the next we of UI that you've noticed we've overhauled the buy cover UI so earlier
9:23
this month we announced that the Foundation Engineering team has completed the overhaul and revamp of The
9:28
Bu covery UI to improve the look and feel of the UI to offer members a smoother flow through the bu cover
9:34
experience to improve load times in the UI and expand transparency around price one capacity and more as a user myself I
9:41
really like that you can see the Max Capacity available in the cover detail section when you're looking to buy cover for a specific product there's also um
9:50
this is also really nice when you adjust the cover period slider because you can see how much capacity is available for
9:56
longer term covers and if you're looking to buy cover for a product for a longer term cover period and there isn't enough
10:03
capacity or there isn't enough capacity to buy for any given period there's now
10:09
an option to request more capacity directly in the UI this is a highly requested feature um which allows
10:15
members to communicate directly with Sten pool managers and Signal demand for cover so capacity can be opened up this
10:20
should help address issues with supply and demand within the mutuals risk Marketplace and this week we've launched
10:26
the cover X notifications if you buy cover you'll now get a notification one week before your cover expires this
10:33
should help members remember to renew their cover as needed if they'd like to renew we'll be rolling out additional
10:38
notifications for members in the future but the cover exploration notifications were prioritized as this has been
10:45
requested by members in the past keep an eye out for more updates on UI improvements and new
10:51
notifications but with that I will hand things over to Hugh to give his foundation update
Updates from the Foundation Team
10:58
H so thanks Brave yeah lot's going on in in defi right now um so yeah you here
11:04
from the on the Nexus main account um this time around um yeah so I think um
11:09
one thing that's interesting with the the yields right now from my perspective is that it seems like the first wave of
11:14
um reaking protocol points and stuff is kind of um coming to an end with the next waves kind of setting up and
11:20
there's a um you know some tokens launching like e five so um it'll be interesting to see how things develop um
11:27
also like with the you know is going down a bit over the last week week or two um the the funding rates um have
11:36
have dampened as well so um so maybe this is just a little bit of a low but
11:42
um but we kind of think that um there's going to be a lot of things coming up in the future maybe with like reaking the
11:48
abss and stuff going live and so expecting um a lot more kind of yield opportunities to to come out and and
11:54
hopefully um most of them are a lot of the ones we're selling cover on right now kind of around the Pendle system um
12:01
like ecosystem and there's there's probably going to be more um more of those types of things coming up so um
12:07
it'd be interesting to see how things develop but um the the yields are still very very strong so um if you're um like
12:13
you know getting 25% on E or even more it's it's quite positive so um lots of
12:19
opportunities out there if if you're willing to do a bit of work um on my
12:25
Foundation update update side of things um yeah the again Lots going on uh one
12:30
of the biggest things we had recently we um have updated the liquid Collective slashing cover um coverage with with
12:38
them um we work together to kind of re re um I guess just to change the term
12:44
slightly have a different slightly different structure to the coverage but fundamentally covering slashing risk on their prot on the cover on the whole
12:51
protocol um so that's been great to get live um and um they've kind of renewed
12:57
that for I believe like a a quarter so um that that's great to see um more
13:03
generally the the performance of the bundle prot protocol cover product um that we've kind of only recently listed
13:10
over the past quarter or so um has been very very strong so we've kind of got 80 million active cover now um we have over
13:18
half a million premiums in in Q2 so far that's basically in the first month of Q2 we've earned more um cover cover
13:26
premiums than we have in all of q1 so so um there's some really strong really
13:31
strong momentum happening at the moment and it's driven primarily off the yield opportunities that are out there and people's willingness to um to buy cover
13:38
to protect those those positions so lots of lots of good things happening there as um as Brave mentioned we've got the
13:46
the UI lot um changes have been been released really happy with theirs they look really really slick and a lot
13:51
better on mobile as as well um so and we'll be releasing more and more um over the coming um months more more different
13:59
sections of things over the coming months um so yeah get have a look at that and check it out if you haven't
14:05
already um a few other bits and pieces um definitely going on um here I can see
14:12
KH has joined us hey KH um we've we're going to be um finally executing on the
14:19
the first stage of the covery deal um very shortly um so we're just kind of finalizing the final pieces of the
14:25
documentation and and then we'll be um looking to to send across the funds um and then we can start discussing the um
14:32
getting into the weeds of the the retrocession deal which will um which will be very interesting for the mutual
14:37
and I think kind of pretty groundbreaking so um as the first part's pretty groundbreaking as well but um
14:43
being at the the edge of Defi and trfi and working out how that works at the
14:48
intersection is all very um very tricky at points but um it can definitely be very rewarding so looking forward to
14:55
getting that um Fully live um and there are a bunch of other things happening with um some new cover
15:03
products launching very soon with some some Partners so um we're looking to do some stuff with open cover um and we're
15:10
looking to do um some some other coverage with some of the other um protocols that I've been building on top
15:16
of this um I'll be able to share more in the coming weeks when they get a bit closer so there's I think there's a
15:22
there's a lot of stuff going on especially with the the product development side of things within the um crypto risk space because um
15:29
it's I think the space in general is maturing a lot and I think there's a lot more opportunities to cover risks that
15:34
um that we've you know haven't necessarily been able to do before um so
15:40
so it's been going really well and and I guess um oh Brave were you were you going to talk about the the governance
15:45
updates a bit um after that yeah I believe you are actually so cool I I'll
15:51
let I'll let you cover all that stuff off um but yeah so I think there's there's quite a few big um governance
15:58
proposals that are that are upcoming so it's worthwhile having a look at the Forum but I'll let I'll let um Brave
16:03
jump into those so I think those are the big things from the foundation side um I guess just to let others know we're also
16:10
hiring uh at the moment so um on the smart contract development side um we've
16:16
also got a new marketing person coming and joining us soon um so yeah excited to expand the team a bit and um I guess
16:23
capture some of the opportunity that that's out there at the moment with um with Def and and the prices and the yields in um generally being quite
16:30
positive so yeah I'm feeling quite good about things at the moment uh happy to take questions um now or later so just
16:38
stick your hand up if you've got something um otherwise I'll just pass over to to bra to kind of go through the
Governance Updates
16:46
governments yeah um yeah I'll cover some governance updates so we've had a busy few weeks on the governance forum and I
16:53
wanted to provide a quick overview of some active proposals the first one is now in the Nexus meal Dow proposal stage
17:01
uh Jeremiah of open cover has requested the grant of 230 nxm that will be used
17:06
to help scale and continue to grow Nexus cover sales on l2s for those of you who aren't aware open cover is a
17:13
distribution platform that's built on top of Nexus mutual and they sell cover on Ace arbitrum optimism and polygon
17:20
proof of stake so they've requested a grant to offset some of the gas costs um
17:26
gas costs have been relatively high in the last few months which Jeremiah has outlined in the Forum but he posted an
17:32
RFC two weeks ago and then he recently um I think on Saturday escalated the two
17:39
and nmdp on the Forum um in the government proposal Jeremiah has summarized open covers performance to
17:44
date sh the impact they've had on cover sales and premium growth and made a case for uh this grant request so you can
17:51
review all of that on the Forum uh if there are no major comments on this this
17:56
will go to vote on Monday April 29th so take an opportunity to review that on the Forum if you have thoughts if you
18:03
have questions feel free to raise those there um I'm happy to clarify anything but I think the best person on this to
18:09
answer questions is Jeremiah but I can also um alert him to any comments that are on the Forum so he can respond in a
18:15
timely fashion um but you can find that it's labeled as nmdp number four Grant to help scale L2 cover purchases via
18:23
open cover on the nextal governance Forum another one that we have that's still in the request for common space is
18:30
a proposal to add usdc as an asset within the capital pool so two weeks ago I posted an RFC to get feedback about
18:37
adding usdc as an asset within the mutual's capital pool so the mutual can
18:42
offer usdc denominated covers I've shared the ration now which is largely based on two factors one members have
18:49
requested to buy usdc denominated covers in the past um we've kind of seen those request increase over time and then if
18:56
we have usdc in the capital pool the potential to underwrite new lines of business with usdc denominated covers
19:03
such as the dpeg cover product that we are currently working on it's currently in development so in the next day I'll
19:10
be posting a formal uh nmip for review this will be up for review for the next
19:16
two weeks before it goes to an onchain vote you can review the RFC in detail on the Forum and share your thoughts and
19:22
comments um again if there are no major comments it'll go to vote but if people um have more comments and want to raise
19:28
questions you know it could be a little bit longer than two weeks so just be sure to go and review that and share
19:34
your thoughts but that won't be going into a formal proposal for for the next day or so uh there is another proposal
19:40
on the Forum about creating the Nexus Mutual Community staking pool and this is an RFC so I've also posted this RFC
19:49
on behalf of the Dow teams this picks up an initiative from 2022 to allocate
19:54
57,000 nxm to stick against protocol cover and bundle protocol cover to help Pro cover sales and meet demand
20:01
originally when we had the wxm buyback in uh late 2021 early 2022 members voted
20:08
on what to uh what to do or how to utilize the wxm that was bought back so
20:13
there were a variety of initiatives and one of them was staking the nxm against cover products within the mutual to grow
20:20
cover sales bring in some premiums um you know this would also add a revenue source for the Dow treasury beyond the
20:27
commissions that we're earning um so I've posted this with an outline of the structure um like I said members have
20:34
already allocated the the 5767 nxm for staking within the protocol
20:40
and a previous mm DP in 2022 so what I'm proposing here is the structure and how
20:45
it would actually be implemented designers can create a new staking pool which would be managed by the product in
20:51
Risk team which would be H and myself to open up capacity for protocol cover and bundle protocol cover products the edim
20:57
of the multi-state with be state for a one-year period and the nxm staking nft would be held within that
21:04
multi um I've proposed the safe multi6 signers on the Forum which will be myself Hugh roxs and Ray um so a mix of
21:12
Dow team and Foundation team uh members and for more information on this one you can review this RFC on the Forum and
21:19
share your thoughts this will transition to a d proposal in the next week as well
21:24
so be sure to review and leave your comments um and then the the last
21:30
proposal that we have on the Forum uh I co-wrote this with Dopey as part of our
21:35
effort to scale cover sales and increase premium growth through the mutual so we're proposing the creation of a
21:41
combined grants and accelerator program that has clear call calls to action to fund oneoff projects and emerging risk
21:47
businesses with the capital they need to build on top of the mutual with more teams building within our ecosystem we
21:53
can expand our distribution develop new products expand in new markets and improve our existing prod and interfaces
22:00
there's a lot of information in The Proposal but the core details are a request of $3 million in nxm to fund
22:06
this program for an 18month period $1 million will be earmarked for the grants program no individual Grant will receive
22:13
more than a 100K um but we're anticipating smaller grants than that um Dopey has broken
22:20
down some of the different categories I imagine I'll be sharing an update on the Forum about that here uh in the next
22:26
week uh but the bulk of the funds to million doll will be used for the accelerator program this should be commitments of up to 500k per team upon
22:34
the accepted to this program for those you aren't familiar with the accelerator uh program format this is kind of like a
22:41
um you know YC combinator or a y combinator program where people would come in we would work closely with them
22:48
on the engineering side on the product development side um these would be more ambitious businesses this would be maybe
22:55
new products that would be expanding into new markets so you know full stack somebody basically created a Syndicate
23:01
which would be a Stak pool a third party interface and then their own distribution system it's built on top of
23:07
the mutual so um we have more details about the accelerator aspect and the
23:13
grand aspect in The Proposal as well um this would be run by a committee that
23:19
would provide quarterly updates to members to highlight the teams that are building within the ecosystem the uh
23:24
grants that have been funded the outstanding rfps and you know the impact that we've had over time with the
23:31
program um this is also going to have a dedicated section on the execu Dow website where anybody can keep up to
23:36
date with things I'll talk a little bit more about the Dow website here in just a minute um and there's a proposed Committee of five members from the
23:42
foundation and DOW teams now there is called act where if you would like to be on the committee you can apply on the
23:48
Forum we have some of the requirements on there as well um this will be up to review for another few days as well this
23:53
has been on the forum for about two weeks so this will go to a dow proposal but please review and share your
23:59
thoughts on the Forum my personal view is that this is a a moonshine opportunity for the mutual we're really
24:05
trying to grow cover sales really substantially and getting people to build on top giving people the resources
24:11
and working working closely with some really skilled teams to build on top and
24:16
expanded in the new markets just represents a huge opportunity there's a lot of one-off grants that we can give
24:22
to people with engineering expertise um you know to to get clarity on on different areas where we can get some
24:28
some legal opinions and improve our interface I mean there's a lot that we can do on the
24:34
grand site as well so um there's a lot that we can do here that will help us supercharge cover sales so I highly
24:40
encourage everyone to review this on the Forum and then I want to talk a little bit about the Dow website which we've
Nexus Mutual DAO Website 2.0
24:47
overhauled so the community team has updated the next next schedual Dow
24:52
website in the last two weeks we've changed things quite a bit we've changed the uh the way it's laid out out we've
24:58
added a lot more pages the goal here is to provide more comprehensive resources
25:04
for members on how to participate within the protocol how to contribute and get involved within the Dow how to learn
25:09
more about the next future ecosystem and who's building on top and how to take advantage of the resources that we have
25:15
for members uh the initial launch has information about the foundation and DOW teams the governance Hub with
25:21
information on the protocol andow governance process as well as an overview of active proposals on the
25:26
governance calendar if you want to keep up to date with all the pills I've just talked about you can look at the governance calendar there is an update
25:33
on what category it's in the time frame for review Once there is a vote that's
25:38
active there'll be a link in there as well um we've also got an overview on ways to participate within the protocol
25:44
a list of our thirdparty Distributors and the many resources we have in the members portal in the coming weeks we're
25:50
going to be adding more content such as videos guides integration resources and more uh we're also going to be working
25:56
on the Stak andc manager hub which will be added sometime during Q2 with resources for new and existing safingol
26:02
managers um we'll be using the Dow website as a place to share core information about the Dow and governance
26:08
as well as updates from the Dow teams please check out the new Dow website let us know if there are any resources that
26:13
you would like to see us at or work on or if there's anything that we can improve uh this project grew initially
26:19
from the governance Hub and staking pool managers Hub deliverables in our last funding request but we really wanted to
26:26
create kind of a central place where people can go and stay up to date on everything find all the resources that
26:32
we have just in one spot so we're trying to make this like a One-Stop shop for anybody who wants to get active within
26:38
