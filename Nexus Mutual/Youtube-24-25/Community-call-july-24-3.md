[Music] welcome everybody to this week's
0:06
bi-weekly Community call we hold our community calls on a bi-weekly basis
0:11
talk about the latest state of defi in risk and yields talk about the latest
0:17
covered Alpha which are the new listings on the Nexus Mutual UI and open cover
0:23
have updates from the team from Hugh and review some of the latest updates and
0:28
governance let's kick things off with a brief review of the state of defi Brave how
Agenda
0:37
how is the state of defi these days what are your notes take it away yeah good morning everyone I'll
State of DeFi
0:44
give a brief overview of the market before we jump into new listings but overall the market seems to be in a
0:50
holding pattern uh looking back on a three month time frame eth is just 3%
0:55
higher than it was 3 months ago and we're down 14% from the local high at the end of May when the announcement
1:02
about the E ETFs went live so everyone seems to be waiting for the S1 approvals
1:07
on the eth ETFs which would allow these ETFs to be issued uh this narrative is currently driving the market and demand
1:14
for leverage in my opinion uh the current funding rates for eth and stable coin yield rates on chain kind of bear
1:20
this out as well um you know everyone's just kind of waiting for for something to happen on
1:28
uh on those e ETFs but looking at the stable coin yields across major markets they range from 8% to 15%
1:36
with a die savings rate setting that 8% yield floor this is down from rates a few months ago which averaged above 20%
1:43
um but some factors in the market have changed since then as well uh the funding rates play a big role since Athena was driving a lot of the demand
1:51
for leverage and stable coin yields yields on Athena have um gone down
1:56
considerably I think they're around 10% right now and the Pendle markets drove
2:01
eth based yields uh in the last several months with their fixed yield markets for lrts but those yields have fallen
2:08
from their 30 to 40% average down to sub 20% yields still quite attractive for ebased yields but 50% of what they were
2:15
months ago those original penal maturities that everybody was deposited in um that were really really popular
2:22
they ended here at the end of June I think it was the 24th and the 26th for most of those maturities so there was a
2:28
pretty large outflow of lsts from the Pendle markets um some people chose to
2:34
roll those over but we're just kind of seeing a a drop off after those
2:39
xrays uh looking at eth based yields on lending markets those range from 1% to 7% so again uh kind of the base rate for
2:48
eth based yields is going to be the eth staking yield which is between three and 4% the notable exception would be
2:54
notional Finance leveraged vaults on arbitrum so notional recently got AR uh
3:00
incentives through an arbitrum Grant um and they are offering those in addition
3:06
to leverage yield on the balancer Aura markets so eth in these markets can
3:11
reach up to 50% apy when the ARB rewards are factored in there are rates on
3:17
stable coins and eth on arbit from you know somewhere between 20 and 50% so
3:22
pretty high yields there but that's kind of outside of the the market average so there are still solid yield
3:27
opportunities that exist on chain but I would expect yields to increase if those e ETFs receive S1 approval or if there
3:33
is some other Catalyst for a bullish narrative in the market um leverage would increase yields would increase and
3:40
I would expect flooding rates to go up and kind of see another push within within the market but in the meantime
3:45
you can still earn yield and protect your positions with some of our new cover L thingss on the product and risk side um
New Listings
3:52
the product and risk team has been pretty busy we've added over 37 new cover listings in the last couple of weeks I'll quickly run through the list
4:00
but a lot of these protocols have been requested um by users or these are areas
4:06
where we're seeing demand for coverage in an increase in deposits on the protocol cover side we've listed super
4:12
form extrafield instad dep fluid Silo Finance
4:17
overnight Finance symbiotic which is the new restak protocol and Spectra which is
4:23
a yield market so a lot of these um like the extrafield uh overnight these are all
4:31
within the Bas ecosystem some of these other ones are newer lending markets and super form is a yield aggregator um that
4:38
is cross chained on the bundle protocol cover side we've listed um more ethery
4:45
related products so the ethery liquid Market neutral USD Vault the super
4:50
symbiotic LRT vaults and then the ethery Carrick Pendle bundle we've also listed
4:57
bundles for the Mellow market so um there are several new listings for
5:03
symbiotic mellow and Pendle markets uh as well as some markets for ssde on
5:10
Pendle and the Sude listing for the carck Pendle Market um we've got some
5:15
other uh Pendle bundles for puffer and Bedrock as well um one for the CRV USD
5:23
Silo Pendle Market um we have some listings just for Melo so Melo is a
5:28
permissionless a reaking layer that's built on top of symbiotic um so you can think of this as
5:34
an LRT built on top of a reaking protocol um we have some of those individual markets the Mev Capital re7
5:41
Labs Steakhouse P2P Market uh markets we have the Morpho blue and metamorpho
5:47
markets for Steakhouse re7 Gauntlet and block analytica and B protocol um we've
5:53
listed some bundles for Toros Finance for some of their um their bull bull
5:59
vaals for for salana ethereum and Bitcoin um those are on l2s and then the
6:04
Tauros Finance andromed yield vault which is on base where they're kind of aggregating the yield from the
6:10
synthetics incentives that are being offered for liquidity providers on base
6:16
we've also got the origin ousd bundle which covers the strategy that underlies ousd a beefy aerodrone bundle one for
6:24
BP's concentrated liquidity manager and Unis swap B3 and index Co-op one that b
6:29
together set protocol V2 coverage and index Co-op coverage and then the notional V3 balancer V2 and AA bundle
6:36
which is going to cover that leverage vaults on arbitrum and ethereum or wherever notional is as long as it's an
6:42
evm compatible chain so that's quite a lot I know um we've been adding more listings to gauge initial Demand on some
6:48
products and we've also been adding new listings based on requests from Members so if there is a new protocol or a
6:54
bundled cover listing that you would like to see on Nexus Mutual just feel free to reach out to me send me a DM on
7:00
Twitter reach out to me on Discord um and just request a review you can also reach out through our contact form on
7:05
the Nexus Mutual website uh I know I went through a lot here so before I move on does anybody have any question
7:11
questions about these listings if you do just feel free to raise your hand and I'll call you
Investment Vote
7:22
up all right if not I'll move on and talk a little bit about the stake wise
7:28
eer investment signaling votes so over the last several weeks Avant guard and ethery have proposed investment
7:36
strategies for the 6,585 whe that's currently idle in the
7:42
Nexus Mutual enzyme vaults the avanguard team has proposed allocating that idle weath to the chorus 1's stake wise V3
7:49
vault in their RFC while the ethery team proposed allocating this we to an investment in um wrapped e in their RFC
7:58
on a forum so members have reviewed both of these proposals they shared their thoughts on how the mutual should allocate These
8:04
funds and members indicated that they' be open to splitting the allocation across two strategies so the investment
8:11
Committee created a signaling vote on Snapshot um that used weighted voting so that members could vote and determine
8:17
what split um they would support ahead of moving this to an nmip or a Nexus
8:23
Mutual protocol Improvement proposal um so before this can move on Shane do will vote about how we allocate this Capital
8:30
uh it needed to go through that governance process needs to go to a final proposal and we needed to figure out what that split was so we put up the
8:37
snapshot vote it was open for five days um the siging vote saw quite a bit of activity and quite a bit of voting on it
8:43
and then once that vote had closed members had reached a rough consensus to split the investment allocation with
8:49
75.8% going to the chorus one stake wise V3 Vault and 24.14% going to eies rapy
8:56
eth so now that the investment committee has has a clear signal on how to proceed the next step is for them to prepare an
9:04
nmip which will be posted on the Forum in the near future once that's been up for roughly two weeks this can proceed
9:11
to an onchain vote where members can vote on whether to move forward with investing that idle e held in the
9:16
mutuals enzyme Vault to that strategy or not um so when that goes to an nmip and
9:24
when it goes on chain for a vote look for announcements on Discord and Twitter will include up dates in our next issue
9:31
of the newsletter that comes out in July as well but um before I hand things over to Hugh does anybody have any questions
9:37
about the investment discussion or the investment signaling
Updates From The Foundation
9:46
vote all right if not I'll hand things over for Hugh to give his foundation
9:52
update H cool thanks Brave um yeah a few things
9:58
going on um I guess the first thing to mention is uh last week we did a a a bug
10:04
related um upgrade on the on the smart contracts um it was a relatively minor one on um on the staking side of things
10:12
um no funds are at risk but um it created some accounting issues on some of the steaking pools and prevented them from um prevented some of them from from
10:19
being delegated to and stuff so um that's that's been fixed um you can see the governance action on chain if you
10:24
have a look um so yeah no major issues there but that was a little bit of work on on the foundation side to get that
10:31
that all sorted um there other things going on we've had um we've released two
10:37
new products um last week um and excuse
10:42
me um and they they've gone live um so really kind of happy with this stuff um
10:48
you if you dive into the um the dashboards you'll be able to see them but um and I'm sure other people are
10:54
going to be making some bigger announcements um Coming forward but just to give you some insight um open covers
11:00
in combination with us have kind of worked together to create a product called transaction cover which basically
11:06
covers a whole bunch of people um just for the very short period of time where they're doing an onchain transaction if
11:12
they interact with a um with a um the bad smart contract or something odd
11:18
happens um like maybe on a bridge or something like that then you um then you can get um cover for that so it's kind
11:24
of bought in bulk um on behalf of a whole bunch of users um conducting transactions doesn't like have a massive
11:30
gas cost on every single transaction um so that that's pretty cool and we're looking to work with um open cover to
11:37
spread that more widely so hopefully you'll be hearing more about that one um but yeah we bought the they built the
11:42
first cover on that um last week which is great and um and I guess the the
11:48
second one um which is pretty big news so you can you can probably see some really decent cover buys coming through
11:53
our biggest one since we launched V2 actually so it's for over 12 million but um we we launched fund cover um which is
12:00
a specific product tailored for um funds that are operating within um defi
12:06
basically allocating um you know either eth or stables and earning yield on them
12:11
um so yield based funds and we've um developed some some tailored um wording um for for particular funds that can
12:18
like basically cover whatever they're allocating to and they don't have to um buy um cover and manage their cover
12:25
positions for lots of different protocols they can buy like one bolt coverage and um as long as they stay within a certain risk framework um then
12:31
they can be covered so um I think that's really interesting um and and this you can see some pretty chunky coverby
12:38
coming through um and that's actually resulted in the in the yields on the staking pools going um quite high so um
12:45
so you can see a couple of them have hit the 30% Mark um pretty recently so um have a have a look at that there's
12:51
obviously some risk involved but um you members have an opportunity to delegate an exm if they wish um so yeah so
12:57
there's um some good news on the on the product side we've been working on this stuff for um
13:03
a little while now several months but than a while for it all to come together and it's um really great to see it see
13:08
it live so hopefully um we can grow both of those um with some new clients and stuff as well so um and there's some
13:15
pretty decent um uh I guess cover fees coming in on those so they're reasonably High rates cuz you know there's a decent
13:22
amount of risk but um but the rate the rates are there I think they're they're fairly priced so um it's a I think it's
13:28
that's a a big um kind of validation for the mutual develop that how we can really kind of get out there and develop
13:34
new products pretty quickly um I guess on that front that we do have some others that we're working on they're a
13:39
bit they got big um bit longer lead times on them probably you know in the kind of 3 to six month type range but um
13:47
but there's some interesting things we're being worked on um in terms of like these are more kind of tailor deals and stuff like this so in combination
13:53
with the the stuff that you kind of see um mainly on the on the app and everything where people buy C for
13:59
particular protocols there's a lot of um tailored bespoke kind of work happening behind the scenes for particular people
14:05
or funds or excuse me other organizations that um that want particular cover and so the the
14:12
foundation has been doing um a lot of work on on those types of things um yeah
14:17
so I guess um other items I'm not sure if I mentioned last time but we've got a new head of marketing um they've joined
14:23
so um Brianna is going to be getting into things a lot more over the over the coming months um you're just kind of
14:29
getting um an understanding of what's going on and how things work um but excited to bring her on and hopefully
14:35
you'll be seeing some some more Outreach and um more visibility from us um in the future um because yeah we've got some
14:41
more resources on that side of things as well um that's that's probably the main stuff happy to happy to take any any
14:48
questions on on any of that
DAO Teams Proposal
15:04
all right if there's no questions I can move on to the next item on our list but
15:10
uh yeah overall I wanted to say I think um with these new bespoke cover products
15:16
um expanding out and doing different kinds of deals and growing the team all of these things are are really going to help us continue to grow cover sales I
15:23
think with the fund portfolio cover this is an easy way for us to um grow cover
15:28
sales pretty significantly and cater to an audience that uh is active on chain and has a lot of capital that they want
15:34
to deploy but also hedge against risk so I think a lot of the things that we're working on on the product side are
15:40
pretty exciting and I'm looking forward to some of the work that we're going to be doing here in the next six months which brings me on to the next Dow teams
15:49
funding request so earlier today on behalf of the active Dow teams I posted an RFC on the forum for our 12month
15:56
funding request so our current request which was for six months that funding period is coming to an end here at the
16:02
end of July and the Dow team leads have outlined the proposed teams their current priorities and the Dow teams
16:09
Collective 12-month budget request in this proposal we're shifting to a 12-month funding request format but we
16:14
still plan to share by annual updates on our progress and priorities going forward because you know within defi uh
16:22
12 months is a long time so we want to make sure that we're updating our priorities and acting accordingly um and
16:28
and sharing that with members for feedback uh and you know just sentiment checking on Direction so you can find
16:34
this proposal on the Forum but I'm going to provide an overview for you on the call of the day as well so if you head
16:41
to the Nexus Mutual governance Forum you'll see this we give uh a review at the top of the funding request uh the
16:48
period the review period for the RFC is going to be from the 2nd to the 16th of July the nmdp uh review period will be
16:56
from the 17th to the 24th of July and then if there's no substantial comments this will go to vote on the 26th and
17:03
we'll be open for voting until the 31st of July um there are a total of five
17:10
teams requesting funding the first is the product and risk team which I am
17:15
leading um and our main focus here over the next six months is going to be um
17:21
launching new products that are currently in development uh we're working on a few products we've just
17:26
launched some products here um in the last week Hugh had mentioned fund
17:31
portfolio cover we have some other cover products that um we've listed to support Sherlock uh we're working with some um
17:39
some other teams too that are developing new products we're going to enter R&D on a new bundled type product that's
17:46
designed to provide cover across multiple protocols it's a little bit different from bundle protocol cover but
17:51
should give people more flexibility um in the protocols they can use while having one cover nft um we're going to
17:58
do some more research and development on a new yield cover product it's a new primitive that we think that can scale
18:04
cover sales pretty significantly um so we're going to be working on that over the next six months we're going to do
18:10
some market research for dpeg cover before moving forward because there's some engineering work involved and we
18:15
want to make sure that there's demain for it so that we can prioritize it accordingly within our current
18:20
engineering pipeline um and then we're going to be supporting new and existing syndicates on new product development as
18:26
we onboard some we have some that are going to be on board in the near future we have some existing syndicates that
18:32
are active and we're supporting them on the product development side and then we're going to be supporting the business development team with point of
18:39
sale Integrations now that we have the ability to offer coverage to users directly in a protocol's front end so
18:45
we're going to be supporting them in any way that we can in the next six months we're also going to start a couple research projects ahead of product
18:52
development one of them is going to be on bridge risk we've had a lot of demand for bridge coverage but um you know
19:00
there's been a lot that's changed here in the last couple of years we need to dig down the particulars ahead of coming
19:06
up with new cover wording so we'll um with this research project we'll get better insight into the current Bridge
19:12
landscape make a risk framework and a pricing model and then start working on that product um and then lending markets
19:18
have changed quite a bit so just putting together a risk framework and a pricing model for that that we can share with
19:23
other syndicates so they can look at that accordingly um and see if this
19:29
impacts anything that we need to update for protocol cover or some of our new products um on this team it's uh myself
19:37
and Hugh primarily I'm heading up this team and just you can see our performance over the last six months but
19:44
some of the overview is we've launched bundle protocol cover we just launched fun for portfolio cover uh you know
19:52
between these two things we've sold around $81 million in cover and earned a significant amount of premiums um then
19:58
we've supported some existing deals as well all of that is included in the Forum on the community Le team this is
20:05
going to be focused on onboarding new members um the priorities there are going to be focused on onboarding new
20:10
members creating guides for members and staking pool managers adding more resources to the Dow website um working
20:17
with the R&D team on a governance research projects coordinating the governance reading group which s has
20:24
started here in the last several weeks which has been really popular continue with the covering defi interview series
20:30
and experimenting and doing some research on how we can engage more with our community how we can attract more
20:36
people to contribute to the mutual and be active within our community um you can see the performance on past
20:42
deliverables on the Forum as well here for the R&D team they are going to be
20:48
focused on pricing inputs on on new products they're going to be working with the product and risk team on that
20:54
um supporting on design and looking for edge cases on technical products and
21:00
working on the business side for engineering heavy products is required um we've hired a new full-time Dune
21:06
analytics wizard um and just an analytics person as well so they're going to be working on updating our
21:12
existing dashboards and creating new dashboards to support the various Dow and Foundation teams um Tomas is also going to be
21:20
working on you know improving our existing queries and then keeping the dashboards up to date with protocol
21:26
changes uh they're going to be working uh on the R&D side they're going to be working uh with the community team again
21:32
on this governance project which you can learn more about on the Forum and then they're going to be working on the MCR
21:37
calculation which is a part of the tokenomics project um this is something that R&D is going to focus on as well
21:45
and then for performance you can look at the work they've done um in the last six months on the Forum as well on the
21:50
investment side um they're looking at the divestment framework which you can
21:55
actually find in the Forum right now and they've been working on these investment proposals that are currently in
22:01
discussion in governance on the Forum they're also looking at Dow treasury
22:07
management and working with the service provider on this um there's a quite a few things that they're looking at on
22:13
that side but there's not much idle Capital left to invest so really it's about ensuring that we have enough um
22:19
eth and Stables to make sure that we can pay claims and that we can satisfy um
22:24
demand for members to exit through the Ram uh so providing Ram liquidity is needed and you can look at their
22:31
performance as well they've talked about some of the investment proposals that have gone up putting together a strategy
22:36
for the Ava V3 usdc loan for the cover Ral um all of that is on the Forum as
22:41
well and then the marketing team so on the Dow side we're going to be hiring some full-time people to help out on the
22:48
marketing team of course as H said we've hired a full-time marketing person to direct our marketing operations but
22:54
we're going to need a social media manager um and potentially one more to build out our marketing team so we
23:01
can really push on the growth side and really um you know strengthen our brand
23:06
and create more awareness about the mutual and our various cover products so that's what the marketing team is going
23:11
to be focused on brand is still building up strategy um and building on her team so we'll have an update on some of the
23:17
priorities on the marketing side as well but I'm really excited for us to build out our marketing team and kind of
23:23
supercharge that department within the mutual to really help us grow cover sales so across all of the Dow teams we
23:30
are requesting 76,500 usdc and 2,464 wxm comparing this to the last two
23:39
six-month funding requests so annualized it's uh for the last 12 months this is about a 113% increase but that doesn't
23:47
reflect the Surplus that the Dow teams used to offset costs in the last year um
23:53
when things were a little bit more bearish so when you factor in the Surplus it's a 44% increase
23:59
from the last 12 months but we have hired a new full-time contributor we plan to hire up to two more full-time
24:05
contributors and this is reflected in that 12-month funding request as well so if cover sales continue at current rates
24:11
though and commissions are generated from those cover sales um based on our current projections those should offset
24:17
more than two-thirds of this funding request or if we continue to grow cover sales from Beyond here we estimate that
24:23
the entire request will be offset by commissions earned from growth and cover sales so those commissions are really
24:29
making a difference in helping us be more sustainable um in operations on the Dow side but yeah this is on the Forum
24:36
and open for everybody's review we try and put as much information here as possible to give members an idea on the
24:42
direction that we're working in and we're also looking for feedback if anyone thinks there are other areas we could focus on or if there are ways the
24:48
teams could um service members better or represent your interests more so feel free to review and share your comments
24:54
on the Forum um I'd be very open to hearing comments from members and uh yeah this will be open for the next
25:00
couple of weeks so looking forward to engagement and if anybody has any questions either now or later you can
25:06
post those on the Forum um but I'm happy to take any questions on this uh funding request right now as
Grants Program
25:22
well okay if there's no questions I will continue on and just provide a brief overview of the grants
25:28
program so in may we launched the grants and accelerator program to help us achieve some of our growth goals this
25:35
grants program has a million in funding for the next 18 months to fund individuals and teams that have the
25:40
expertise necessary to conduct in-depth research build out our tactical infrastructure for new syndicates and
25:45
Distributors and improve the user experience and then in simplify the integration process so the grants
25:52
program is focusing primarily on these following priorities legal and Regulatory techical product improvements
25:59
improving the user experience distribution and marketing and integration composability I'll provide
26:04
an overview of a few key requests for proposals or the rfps that we have on the Dow website on the grants page one
26:12
of them is the covered yelds Marketplace there is available funding for up to $50,000 for this grant we're looking for
26:19
a team to create a Marketplace or modify their existing Marketplace to allow users to deposit into a vault that
26:25
includes native coverage by default or with cover prominently presented in the user interface through a point of sale
26:31
integration that can be an add-on in a bundle transaction this functionality would provide users with a really easy way to
26:38
approaches protection at the point of deposit so each posit is uh deposit is covered
26:43
automatically we're also looking for um a team to help us with hackathon
26:49
incentives so we're looking for someone to design a hackathon incentives program for us the available funding for this
26:55
grant is up to 50,000 um we're looking for an individual or small team to create or sponsor hackathons that bring
27:02
together talented solidity developers to solve problems build new features and find ways to improve the Nexus Mutual
27:08
protocol these hackathons should act as a funnel for hiring or partnering on ecosystem projects um another RFP that's
27:16
pretty high on the priority list is um an incentive distribution contract for staking pools available funding for this
27:22
is up to 15,000 um we're looking for an individual or team to develop a smart contract track that gives staking pool
27:29
managers the ability to add token incentives to their pool this helps with the cold start problem when somebody
27:35
launches a new pool and wants to attract Capital these incentives should be distributed to the individual nxm
27:41
stakers who have allocated Capital into a given pool the final deliverable should be production ready code that can
27:46
be audited and connected to an individual staking pool um this is a relatively a simple contract but
27:53
something that would be nice for someone to develop that we can bolt on to these existing staking pools we're also
27:58
looking for somebody to help us with uh a broker sales and product package funding for this is up to 10,000 and
28:05
we're looking for somebody that has experienced creating Brokers packages in the past to create a compelling package
28:10
for uh Brokers or people that want to help us distribute coverage this can serve as the standard package used to
28:17
onboard the next 100 Brokers over the next several years um some grants that we have that
28:23
have higher available budgets so both of these have up to $100,000 available for
28:29
them one of them is a defi integrated wallet solution so somebody that can build a solution that would allow
28:34
wallets centralized exchanges and or aggregators to natively integrate Nexus Mutual coverage into their interfaces
28:41
and allow their users to purchase protection um through at at the transaction layer when they're looking
28:47
to deposit um you would have something that would prompt you directly in a wallet uh the other one is licensed
28:53
Insurance research so we're looking for um somebody with legal expertise to conduct research to identify how a third
29:00
party operating as a Syndicate can become licensed and offer insurance without requiring the mutual to move
29:05
capital offchain or convert Capital into Fiat if the outcome of that Research indicates that it is impossible for a
29:11
Syndicate to become licensed then we would expect that report to include uh the changes that would be required to
29:17
allow a Syndicate to become licensed so again these are a selection of the highest priority grants but we have
29:23
other rfps on the grants page as well we're also looking for Grant application ID that are outside of the existing rfps
29:30
we have just as long as they fit within our current priorities so if you have an idea if you would like to build on top
29:35
of the mutual or if you have something that fits into our current priorities and you'd like to seek a grant check out that page on the Dow website you can
29:42
learn more about the grants program on the Dow website and we can share that link to the Dow website in the thread
29:48
for today's call shortly I want to move on and talk a little bit about open cover as well so
OpenCover Growth
29:55
open cover is a distributor that's built on top of next Mutual they distribute
30:00
cover on l2s like Bas optimism arbitrum um and I wanted to highlight
30:06
them because they've grown quite a bit in Q2 so we're working on our um Q2
30:11
insights report for 2024 but I wanted to give you a preview of some of the growth that open cover has seen since they've
30:18
boosted their cover sales by 112% since q1 of this year in Q2 open cover sold
30:24
6.32 million in cover and they earned the mutual 44k in premium through 180
30:30
cover sales with an average of 60 covers per month as more users move to l2s to
30:35
participate in defi having partners like open cover and the Nexus Mutual ecosystem is incredibly powerful open
30:41
cover is also um they've kind of moved to The Syndicate layer they have their own staking pool and they are you know
30:49
working to expand their offerings as well but open cover is offering users a solution for those who don't want a kyc
30:57
or those who are looking to buy smaller covers and want to be able to buy covers somewhere where the gas costs aren't
31:02
going to make it cost prohibited for them so they're providing a really great alternative to joining the mutual as a
31:08
member and instead using open cover this layer that's built on top of us that's going to help us scale retail cover
31:14
sales so they've also been working on a new product as well which can help the mutual sell a significant amount of
31:20
cover in the coming years they are very laser focused on growth um I was just talking with Jeremiah from open cover
31:26
earlier today and they have a lot in the pipeline so they're focused on growth just like the foundation of Dow teams and I'm
31:31
really looking forward to working with open cover in Q3 and Beyond if you haven't heard of open cover before I
31:37
recommend checking them out on Twitter and heading to their website we'll share a link to open cover and the thread for
31:42
today's call as well uh and with that I'll turn things over to Sam to review the last week in numbers
Last Week in Cover Sales
31:51
Sam all right um let's look at the last week and review cover sales and fees
31:57
earned last week was a great week where members sold more than $25 million worth of
32:03
cover and um the mutual earned more than $165,000 in
32:09
fees and um some of the top products that were sold last week were bundled
32:15
protocol covers that included igen layer constellations also ether fire liquid
32:22
ethal had saw a big cover by over $10 million
32:29
and um the average exper period has uh has been lengthened to 29
32:36
days when we look at the Active cover for per product type we see that the
32:44
fund portfolio cover that Hugh mentioned earlier that was just recently launched
32:49
made a strong entrance we now have 14% 14.3% of our entire active coverage in
32:57
fund portfolio cover and I think it's a great success that we have bundle protocol cover here as well with
33:06
24.7% of our representing 20 more than 24% of our active cover um as we have
33:13
new products we will be diversifying our active coverage some more and I'm looking forward to
Governance Reading Group
33:21
that while I'm met it I'd love to give a brief brief update from the governance
33:27

33:32
our core objectives at Nexus mutual and we are trying to enrich theme
33:38

33:59
and we have also recently put up a new reading list for the third and fourth
34:06

34:12
references that we have come across and um it's also nurtured from the decentralized society seminar that was
34:19
recently held at MIT with that I want to open the space
Open Forum
