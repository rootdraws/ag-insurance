[Music] hey everyone welcome to this week's
0:06
Nexus Mutual Community call it's great to have you join us as we catch up on
0:12
everything happening in the Nexus Mutual ecosystem here is a quick look at what's
Agenda
0:19
on the agenda today Brave New defi who is joining us from the Nexus Mutual main
0:25
account is going to walk us through the latest in defi including the current
0:31
yield and risk landscape we will also cover governance updates there is a lot of talk on the
0:38
Forum about new functionality and changes to the capital pulse asset structure so we'll dive into that
0:45
too to wrap things up we've got some sneak peeks from our upcoming Q2 growth
0:52
report and we'll open the floor as always for questions and comments also
0:57
stick around to find out how to grab your all right let's jump into defi Brave
1:05
what's new in this space good morning everybody it is brave
State of DeFi
1:12
new defi on the Nexus Mutual accounts I'll go through uh an overview of the
1:18
current market and the yield environment in defi before we jump into some other updates
1:23
today since our last call eth is down about 8% though eth has seen an increase
1:28
of 3.64% in the last week uh there's really just
1:33
one major well there's a couple catalysts for kind of the the drop at the end of September um you know the
1:42
conflict in the Middle East has kind of led to a scare on the markets that things
1:48
might ramp up and it might pull in other uh countries across the world into this larger conflict uh doesn't look like
1:54
there's any signs of tension easing and there's been New Waves of conflict uh in the region
2:00
since we talked last so I anticipate that the market is going to correct and kind of react to this has
2:08
developed was overtime uh on the other hand the September jobs report of the United States has helped drad F markets
2:15
rebound from that correction but that market momentum isn't likely to have the same impact on crypto markets uh the
2:22
Stellar jobs report means the FED likely won't be as aggressive with rate Cuts in the near term with many Market analysts
2:28
predicting a 25 basis point rate cut instead of the 50 uh 50 basis points
2:34
rate cut that we saw previously uh the United States election is also drawing closer and this too will have an impact
2:40
on crypto markets I'm sure if you look on crypto Twitter there's a lot of people um talking about a Buller
2:46
scenario if Trump is elected in the US we'll have to wait and see where the
2:51
market takes us in the next month despite this downturn though Traders have grown more bullish than last week
2:57
with the median e funding rate increasing by 81% from 5.03% to
3:04
9.10% the highest funding rate is currently on DDX where Traders are paying uh
3:09
3.57% to go long on eth and on the other end of the spectrum Traders on opx are being paid 1.76% to go along on eth
3:17
based on what I've seen we're still in a holding pattern between that 2,200 and $2,800 range the market is kind of
3:25
waiting for a major Catalyst to move another Direction I know I've said that before but it still true we're kind of
3:30
in the scrap Market going in between those two ranges the correction has been fleed uh reflected in the onchain base
3:37
rate as well which dropped by 30% from 6.99% which is the rate when we last
3:43
spoke down to 4.86% this week Ys across lending markets were higher but they've
3:50
settled down just above short-term US Treasury rates if on train onchain
3:55
interest rates were to drop below short-term us treasuries that would show a lack of inent to drive more capital on
4:01
chain in previous weeks wara vaults have been contributing a sizable amount of yield but the rates in those vaults have
4:06
trended closer or to or below 9 or 10% from a high level vantage point the
4:12
emerging lending markets like Moro fluid moonwell exactly and some others are all
4:17
seeing a median interest rate around seven to eight% um while mature markets like a
4:23
and compound are seeing a Medi interest uh interest rate around four to 5% uh you know as you get more size as
4:30
TBL grows in these markets that interest rate usually comes down to that you know four to 5% range so while lending rates
4:38
um have hovered in this range sky or formerly maker Dow since they've done the Rebrand they're now Sky they've redu
4:45
the die savings rate to 5.5% and increase the sky savings rates to 6.5%
4:52
so that onchain Benchmark is now close to 2% higher than the onchain base rate
4:57
that should help move the base rate higher in coming weeks as more users adopt usds uh Sky's new stable coin and
5:04
deposit that into the sky savings rate module there's still a lot of great yield opportunities out there in D5
5:10
protocols I know I say this every week but there are always high yield opportunities on chain um you just have
5:17
to kind of know where to look and check the lending markets for that base rate
5:23
and then look at some of the yield aggregators out there I've been keeping an eye on Dex yields for correlated
5:29
pairs across Unis swap B3 Aerodrome valad Drome camlot ramsy gamma swap pancake Swap and some others I've also
5:36
found that the 30-day average yields which you can find on uh vault. FYI or
5:42
on defi Lama I found that those 30-day average yields are in the 20 to 30% range on both eth and stable coin pairs
5:50
um that are on some of these dexes so right now Unis swap pancake Swap and
5:55
vome have had the best deals over the last week though I still keep an eye on
6:00
Aerodrome ramsy and camot as well you can look for some of the notable yields that I highlight in my next issue of the
6:06
standard defi yields newsletter that's going to come out tomorrow and again I always highlight some notable yield
6:12
opportunities which usually include syx yields lending markets uh still have
6:18
good yields I found Kango is a really reliable protocol to look for leverage yields across lending markets especially
6:25
with uh eth or LST assets so Kango allows you use leverage to farm across
6:31
lending markets and other protocols uh it does use leverage so we should always exercise caution when taking out
6:36
leverage and farming yield but if you want to LP without worrying about harvesting rewards then you could always
6:43
use beefy which uh automates and harvests those rewards for you and puts
6:48
them back into the lp um the 30-day average yields in some of those be
6:53
volets are between 15 to 45% so um still very good yields on beefy I've also been
7:00
learning more about Arcadia which is non-chain credit Market on base where you can Farm leverage yields create your
7:05
own strategies and you can also lend crypto assets to earn yield Arcadia tvl
7:10
recently Rose above five million but Arcadia has been around for more than a year they provide curated leverage
7:16
strategies that you can choose from which use underlying uh the underlying Aerodrome and Unis swap B3 pools as the
7:23
yield source and depending on the amount of Leverage that you select you can earn anywhere between 20% to 300%
7:30
apy uh I do want to note here that you know you have to pay interest on the assets you're borrowing when you open
7:36
leverage and you take on the risk of impermanent loss when you're using a strategy uh like some of the ones that
7:41
are provided on Arcadia so always weigh the risk with reward and always be sure to you know look and make sure that it's
7:48
something that you want to do and that you know you don't want to suffer in permanent loss and pay those fees and
7:53
how the rewards get out of whack over time but um Arcadia is very cool it kind of it lets you design your own custom
7:58
strategies so there's a lot of flexibility there and it's been pretty NE to learn about um but if you don't
8:04
want to take on Leverage if you don't want to use some of those more advanced strategies you can always lend your assets and earn yield that way um you
8:10
know very similar to what you can do on extraios Arcadia still has that um
8:15
Arcadia lenders can earn pretty decent yields so USD lenders are currently
8:21
earning 9% and CB BTC lenders are earning 8% on Arcadia you also earn
8:26
Arcadia points not really sure what those points Translate to but um you know it's uh just some extra gravy on
8:33
top I guess uh I'll have more in this week's issue of the state of defi yields
8:38
so if you want to read more about onchain lending markets the onchain base rate some of these notable yield opportunities in my latest risk report
8:46
you can check out that newsletter on substack um I'll put out some announcements when I post that this week as well uh I wanted to talk a little bit
8:53
about the state of the mutual too so as I've shared in past calls we're working with open cover to launch the D5 pass
9:00
cover product open cover has been running a beta launch of the first listing the base D5 pass and since that
9:07
beta has been live the Mutual has sold 353,000 of Base defi pass cover so in
9:14
just a short amount of time with a limited number of users in the beta um you know we sold a pretty large amount
9:19
of Base defi pass cover for the testing phase feedback so far has been overwhelmingly positive we have received
9:26
um some feedback on some minor things so we're working with open cover to twe the UI update some of the information to
9:31
make things clearer and get ready for a full public launch of the Bas defi pass incoming weeks we're also going to be
9:38
working to scale some of that capacity for the Bas def5 pass to support that launch so if you're interested in buying
9:44
Bas def5 pass cover you can head over to the open cover UI open cover is going to be the sole distributor of the Bas D5
9:50
pass since users are able to buy the pass directly on the Bas Network through open cover and as a reminder uh if you
9:56
haven't heard me talk about the base def5 pass for it Prov provides protection across Aerodrome BP compound B3 extra moonwell Moro overnight and
10:05
Unis swap B3 on base as well as any underlying protocols used by any these protocols it's all defined in the Annex
10:13
in the uh protocols and subprotocol section the pass is priced at 3.99% and
10:18
you'll be able to move funds between these protocols without losing your coverage you just have to make sure that the covered amount you keep um is you
10:26
know higher or equal to the aggregate total that you have deposit across all these protocols so it's maximum
10:33
flexibility means comprehensive protection so you don't have to worry about buying multiple covers to protect your crypto assets deposited in you know
10:40
these leading protocols on base so on a higher level view um outside of the base defi pass the Mutual
10:47
has been growing cover sales um we've been you know seeing a lot of interest in the Fel protocol cover products some
10:54
of our very popular protocol cover products like Ava V3 protocol cover and now um with some of these newer products
11:01
that we've been listing you know we're seeing a lot more cover being sold uh but in the last week we've had a really
11:06
major Milestone we've hit the five billion in total cover underwritten since our launch in
11:12
2019 but now it's getting to that $10 billion Mark um which hopefully comes
11:17
here in the next few years but if you want to learn more about the mutuals cover sales you could check out the
11:23
covers Dune dashboard we're also close to finalizing a couple new staken Dune dashboards you can find those on the
11:29
Nexus Mutual Dune analytics page as well uh but you can learn more about the
11:35
staking pool uh individual staken pool performance um and aggregate across all the staking pools you can look at nxm
11:42
rewards that are being earned current exposure for each individual pool and more I've already used some of the new
11:48
Dune dashboards to put together this week's Community staking pool update which I'll go over now so you can find
Community Staking Pool
11:55
these bi-weekly updates about the community staking pool on the Nexus Mutual governance Forum I covered the
12:00
pool's current exposure and the rewards that Des earned from cover sales I've been doing this here for the last uh
12:06
three updates which has been the last six weeks and I'll continue to post updates in there but as of this week the
12:11
community staking pool is underwriting about six million in active cover across the listings that are outlined in the
12:17
Forum post but the top five listings by exposure are as follows igen lier ether
12:23
5 b a protocol cover uh the pool is underwriting about 1.4 million av3
12:28
protocol cover the pool is underwriting underwriting uh 1.37 million dialectic
12:34
Moon fa uh moon phase fund portfolio cover the pool is underwriting 1.18
12:40
million and the dialectic chronograph fund portfolio cover the pool is underwriting again another 1.18 million
12:48
and Arcadia protocol cover the pool is underwriting about 340,000 in that uh
12:54
listing as well so since the staking Community staking pool launched it's earned to total of 821 nxm between
13:01
staking rewards management fees this of course goes back to the down treasury so
13:06
we're earning rewards there and kind of growing the treasury over time and opening up capacity for some of these
13:12
Popular cover products B and buy cover pool 23's current active cover has
13:17
earned the pool 464 nxm in rewards with 112 nxm earned so far and another 352
13:24
nxm and pending rewards which will be streamed over the remaining days of the individual listings uh for the active
13:31
cover periods the pool is earning 12.82% API which is a slight increase since
13:37
last update we shared which I believe was 12.66% API so it's a little bit
13:42
higher here um over the past two weeks and if you want to see more information
13:48
about the community St pool you can check out the Nexus Mutual governance Forum uh I also post updates about my
13:54
own pool pool 22 I'm hoping that more pool managers can kind of post updates and give people
14:00
uh a better view on their exposure but again some of those Dune dashboards will
14:05
allow you to check any of the sing pools that are active on Nexus Mutual so I guess some of these updates have been
14:10
automated but I'll continue posting these updates with a little bit of color on the Forum now I want to jump into a
Governance Updates
14:17
little bit more information on the governance Forum so in other governance news the rfcs that I spoke about on the
14:23
last call have now all transitioned to n's Mutual protocol Improvement proposals and so these NM Pips are open
14:30
for review and will go up for an Onre vote on Thursday the 17th of October
14:35
I'll provide a brief overview of each proposal before handing things over to Hugh for his foundation update the first
14:41
one is the nmip to approve the addition of delegated claims for select product
Delegated Claims
14:47
types so the foundation and DOW teams have been working to grow cover sales and onboard new
14:53
syndicates uh we're currently working to on board a new Syndicate um they've posted on the Forum they're called
14:59
native and that can have a that can meaningfully contribute to the growth of cover sales so native will require
15:05
additional functionality offer new product types through their sticking pool specifically the ability to
15:11
delegate to an ethereum address as a designated assessor this function would enable certain product types to have a
15:17
designated thirdparty claim assessor as defined in the cover wording for that product type so if someone were to buy
15:23
cover for a product type with delegated claims enabled and claims for that product type would only be assessed by
15:28
that designated claim assessor uh Native has actually replied on the RFC and outlined why they need this um that they
15:35
have their own experts for you know the products that they're planning to offer
15:40
and those experts can go through and look at information that um may not be on chain uh and assess those claims so
15:47
they're going to have some of their own Third Party Experts that are going to be assessing claims and this is you know crucial for some of their clients that
15:53
they're working with so on behalf of the foundation and DOW team I propose that members approve the addition of
15:59
delegated claims functionality for select product types doing so will enable the mutual to onboard new types
16:04
of syndicates like native that have established distribution in onchain and offchain markets If This nmpi Were to be
16:11
approved then the mutual could work with uh certain St and pool managers to create new cover products that would
16:16
have this requirement to have a designated claim assessor rather than opening the claim vote to all members as
16:22
we currently do for all of our other product types at the moment so this would allow specialized assess is to
16:29
review a claim and this would allow us to expand into new lines of businesses uh so definitely something to keep an
16:35
eye on if you want some more detail I would recommend checking out the nmip on the Forum uh but the RFC has received
16:41
broad support from Hugh Dopey and then Dan from native um again native is that new sticking pool that's launched on
16:47
Nexus Mutual um again really encourage everyone to read this proposal this nmpi
16:52
is going to be open for review uh from the 4th of October until the 16th of October and then after that review
16:58
period that npip is going to move to an onchain vote on Thursday the 17th of October any questions on this uh nmip
17:06
before I move on to the next
Offboarding DAI
17:14
summer okay if not let's talk about offboarding die is a capital pool asset
17:20
so as I've covered before maker die was are rebranded to Sky and they've launched their new stable coin
17:25
usds um people can convert die to usds uh as of today usds is almost to 1
17:34
billion in TBL and D is down to about 3.34 billion in tvl so um D has been
17:43
around five billion so between those two uh essentially kind of staying around that five billion number but more people
17:49
are converting their die over to usds you can still convert usds back to
17:55
die but sky is going to be you know essentially prioritizing usds growth
18:01
over die growth you can see that from the shift they've made where they've increased Sky savings rate and decreased the die savings rate so usds is going to
18:08
be the primary token that's going to receive support um and a big growth push
18:14
from Sky over time so that given sky is moving toward more real world asset
18:20
backing um and usds has that Blacklist function uh you know we on the product
18:25
and risk team anticipate that die denominated cover demand is going to further shrink as you know die kind of
18:32
Fades Into Obscurity over time so I'm proposing that next Mutual members vote to off four die as a capital pool asset
18:38
and Grant The Advisory Board the power to complete the four stages of of offboarding which would be the first one
18:44
would be disabling DED and nominated cover buys at user interface level and waiting until the last die cover expires
18:50
and the greatest period for that cover to end and then all of the die in the capital pool would be swapped for usdc
18:56
and then the last one would be offboarding die as an asset in the capital pool so since usdc was on board
19:02
to the capital pool we've seen a lot more growth in usdc denom covers um you
19:08
know die cover has dropped uh in relative terms you can see on the covers dashboard where it is um there's only
19:15
really been one large cover buyer that's been denominating a die um you know some of their covers have expired and
19:21
everything so I think that we'll see that D exposure die down over time and of course the core reason that we had
19:27
die in the capital pool was because it was censorship resistant but as you know that's kind of trending the other way
19:33
with usds having that Blacklist function um you know we don't see a reason to keep it in the capital pool so in the
19:40
future we may look to onboard usds once it's achieved more growth and if demand for usds not the cover is evident but as
19:48
of now um we think that USD uh usdc is sufficient for a stable coin asset for
19:55
cover denominations you can check out more on the Forum but this nmpi is going to be open for review from the 7th of October
20:02
until the 16th of October and then of course this like the other two um NM Pips is going to go for an onchain vote
20:09
uh starting on Thursday the 17th of October any questions on this one before I move on to the next
20:18
one okay uh and then the last MP I want to summarize was onboarding CB BTC as a
Onboarding cbBTC
20:24
capital pool asset so coinbase launched CB BTC um on the 12th of September so it's been
20:31
live for just about a month now uh onboarding CB BTC as a capital
20:38
full asset would present the mutual with a competitive Advantage as the foundation and DOW teams look to expand
20:43
into new lines of business and appeal the a broader audience of Crypton native users um just in the last month CB BTC
20:50
has grown uh exponentially and I imagine that's going to be the case over time as well on behalf of the product and rist
20:56
team I'm proposing that next Mutual members vote to onboard CBBC as a capital pool asset and Grant The
21:02
Advisory Board the power to complete the three stages of onboarding first one would be onboarding CBBC as an asset to
21:07
Capital pool and then swapping e for $1 million of CBBC and then enabling CBBC
21:14
denominated cover buys at the user interface level I talk about why in The Forum post why cbtc um I've outlined
21:22
things in pretty great detail on the Forum but The quick summary since CB BTC
21:27
launched reached a market cap of 307 uh 357 million as of this morning with
21:34
5,731 BTC backing CBBC so this put CB BTC in the top 10 of bridge TBL rankings
21:41
on defi llama in just one month's time I imagine that they're going to eat more market share but they currently have I
21:46
think it's 6.31% of the uh BTC derivative market share already they're poised for growth
21:54
um at the institutional layer and across defi major lending protocol have already integrated CB BTC into their markets and
22:01
given that coinbase is the primary custodian for you know both the BTC and E ETFs I think there's a pretty high
22:08
likelihood that CB btc's market share will grow substantially by the end of this year onboarding CB BTC is going to
22:15
provide us with a competitive advantage to get into new lines of business underwriting um companies that mine
22:23
BTC uh expanding into things like BTC reaking and then catering to Crypt users
22:29
who have you know wbtc or other BTC derivatives on chain that are looking to
22:34
denominate their covers in BTC asset so I outlined things in a bit more detail
22:40
on the Forum I recommend you check that out um I go over the business cases and the risk associated with
22:46
onboarding uh CBBC to the capital pool so you can see that npip on the Forum uh
22:52
this proposal is going to be open for review from the 8th of October today until the 16th of October after this
22:58
review period the nmip is going to move to an onchain vote on Thursday the 17th of October any questions on this
23:05
proposal before I hand things over to
23:12
you okay if not I'm sure everyone is tired of hearing me talk so I will hand
23:17
things over to Hugh to provide us with the foundation updates for the week
Updates From The Foundation
23:23
Hugh cool thanks Brave yeah a couple of things um just want to firstly comment on the the government's proposals really
23:30
excited with both the CB BTC one and the delegated Claims One on the the CB BTC
23:38
one like um I guess from a business perspective I see kind of two main things here one is the BTC like staking
23:45
reaking um like projects and um I guess narrative and there's seems to be a lot
23:51
of stuff being built up around that um and if there's you know they'll um have slashing and and also smart contract
23:58
risk um and script risk on on the BTC chain so I think there's um there's a
24:04
lot of latent capital in in BTC world world that's like kind of could look for
24:10
yield if the yields are attractive enough and the risk for turn profile is right um and so I think um being
24:15
prepared for that potential narrative shift um could be um could be quite um promising for us so um it's not quite
24:23
there yet and thing projects are only just starting but being prepared and having the capability to write BTC
24:28
nominated covers um I think is going to be quite powerful there um I think also worth noting that there are a lot of um
24:35
companies within the crypto space that obviously have a lot of exposure that's very closely linked to um BTC for
24:42
example Bitcoin miners Etc run property risks um like business Interruption type risk Etc they want they actually want
24:49
BTC denominated covers for um a chunk of that coverage and they can't really Source it from traditional markets
24:55
because traditional markets have to price in usdd US dollar terms um so I think um that's a that's a potential um
25:02
extra um Market that we could go after as well so yeah pretty excited about that one the second one being the
25:08
delegated claims um I encourage you all to read natives post um the the the that
25:15
kind of gives you a very good outline of why this is why this is needed um the it gives you it gives potential cover p a
25:22
lot more confidence that um that they can um be comfortable that claims will be paid Etc um rather than this you know
25:30
bit strange weird crypto thing on the side there it's it's a lot more familiar to them and so I think that can open up
25:35
the potential markets for for cover buyers a lot um more broadly on on
25:40
Native um that they've going to do a more detailed or more um promotion or
25:47
announcement about um our partnership with them um over the coming weeks but I guess just to give you a little bit of a
25:53
heads up here on this call um there uh Professional Insurance Brokers that have
25:58
been doing crypto asset um broking for several years um and they're just kind
26:04
of forming together under a new Banner um and we're partnership partnering with them to kind of expand and so they're
26:11
they're going to be looking to place um lots of I guess businesses working in
26:16
the crypto space that have um like crypto exposure they're looking to
26:21
replace more traditional type policies um with Nexus but also with traditional
26:27
insurance companies um but we're looking to kind of partner with insurance companies and native to kind of say I
26:33
know say a um a business wants 10 million of coverage maybe they can only sell us 5 million from traditional
26:38
markets and then they can add on an additional 5 million from Nexus and that type of thing is we think there's a quite a large market for that so they're
26:45
just ramping up at the moment they've just got their regulatory licenses and um they're all kind of um onboarding a
26:52
new team and stuff so they're going to be um doing some really good things next year in particular but they're ramping
26:58
up at the moment and hopefully they can get their first um cover sales um coming through soon so you would have seen
27:04
they've um you can see on chain that they've started pool 28 um I think it's 28 from memory um but I haven't quite
27:11
started delegating and um and actually writing the business through there but that's that's what Native are that's
27:16
what um they're about um you should read a bit more on the on the forums and um look out for some further announcements
27:22
on that because yeah it's it's pretty exciting for the mutual and hopefully they're going to be a really powerful Syndicate um
27:28
um in the future for us so I guess more broadly on that in terms of foundation update um there is a lot of work in
27:35
general supporting all the Bunches of different syndicates out there so um braver is mentioning open cover and the
27:41
defi passs we're working heavily with them on the marketing side as well as the kind of product development side and
27:46
making sure that the um the products are working in the right ways and stuff like that um so they're St open cover
27:52
starting to really push um this stuff out and you'll probably notice that they sell a lot of the covers on on Nexus
27:57
that they're generally a bit smaller on average but um but in terms of number of um they're definitely making a
28:04
meaningful difference I think if a third or even a half of the cover buys come from them um so you know that that's
28:10
pretty powerful um so we're with um we're also developing products on like
28:16
the bug b coverage side um at the moment for for you know a few potential syndicates and partners there um that
28:23
seems to be um a definite area for where projects can essentially
28:28
um get some coverage for if they have to pay out a large bug bounty on a critical bug then they can they can get some coverage there so um you know higher
28:36
price coverage and all the rest of it but um still there's a there's a kind of a meaningful um premium that we could
28:42
get from the mutual could get in in that respect so um pretty exciting um a bunch
28:48
of different syndicates and products that that we're kind of supporting and I think that's a kind of a large chunk of the the foundations work over the coming
28:54
weeks and I think we'll even more the coming months um so yeah and there's a few there I can't quite mention yet that
29:01
a bit further um along in the development process but um there's there's a lot of work um on that side of
29:06
things I guess then I'll just flip to the kind of engineering um side of
29:12
things so um the that's kind of I guess the two main things we're working on distribution and growth and then
29:17
obviously the protocol engineering stuff um so on the protocol engineering side um in terms of like product features the
29:24
kind of list we're working through at the moment is um we've got uh we're just going to ship
29:32
tomorrow most most likely a small technical upgrade to um give us some more flexibility on the swapping
29:38
function um I guess that's a relatively small one but um just to let you know what happening and um you can see you
29:43
can probably see the governor's proposal in in the process there um it's just na only one cuz it's a small technical
29:49
change um there then there's that one then we've got um work on cover edits um
29:56
continuing then we've got work on delegated claims um continuing um and
30:02
then we have also got some work on limit orders um so you know you should be able
30:08
to um for example sign a message and and that you want like I don't know 5 million coverage on Unis Swap and um if
30:16
if that becomes available a worker or bot can execute that um it also allows some really cool
30:23
interesting ux type um enhancements where like you can potentially do um
30:30
like monthly cover um purchases and things like that so there's quite a few interesting pieces to do there so limit
30:35
orders are quite quite exciting um so there there's those few um pieces on
30:40
there development Rob apps are very kind of feature oriented um driven by product feedback from native and and other
30:48
syndicates as well as kind of end users as well and then we've got the UI
30:53
enhancement so the staking Das the staking UI um in particular is the next one um that being worked through at the
30:59
moment the the new the new screens and stuff that we're working through they look pretty cool um be good to get
31:04
everything onto a onto the new um nice UI um that the buy cover um stuff's on
31:10
at the moment so um those are probably the big things on the uh engineering side there's obviously also some back
31:16
end stuff and things that we're working on that um are just making sure things are um smooth and we can deploy fast and
31:23
all and all the rest of it um so those are kind of the the big things that we're work working on and I guess
31:29
probably just to mention um in terms of Team size with the whole kind of Nexus um Team whether that's across the
31:35
foundation or um kind of directly from the Dow there about 15 or 16 people um
31:41
and we've got um about five or six engineering resources there so that's just kind of give you the kind of I
31:47
guess overview of um the team um I think that's the main stuff I'm
31:53
probably missing a few things but um those those are the main things like two main focuses growth in distribution and
31:59
supporting syndicates and definitely the engineering from a product feature um
32:04
point of view especially to support the growth in those syndicates so those are the main two things we're focusing on at
32:09
the moment yeah any questions just shout um or you can feel free to P me later on
32:15
