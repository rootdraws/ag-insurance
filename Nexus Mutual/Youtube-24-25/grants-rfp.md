so in may we launched the grants and
0:02
accelerator program to help us achieve
0:03
some of our growth goals this grants
0:05
program has a million dollars in funding
0:07
for the next 18 months to find
0:09
individuals and teams that have the
0:11
expertise necessary to conduct in-depth
0:13
research build out our tactical
0:14
infrastructure for new syndicates and
0:16
Distributors and improve the user
0:18
experience and then in simplify the
0:20
integration process so the grants
0:23
program is focusing primarily on these
0:25
following priorities legal and
0:27
Regulatory tactical product improvements
0:29
improving the user experience
0:31
distribution and marketing and
0:32
integration composability I'll provide
0:35
an overview of a few key requests for
0:37
proposals or the rfps that we have on
0:39
the Dow website on the grants page one
0:42
of them is the covered yals Marketplace
0:44
there is available funding for up to
0:46
$50,000 for this grant we're looking for
0:49
a team to create a Marketplace or modify
0:51
their existing Marketplace to allow
0:53
users to to deposit into a vault that
0:55
includes native coverage by default or
0:58
with cover prominently presented in the
1:00
user interface through a point of sale
1:02
integration that can be an add-on in a
1:04
bundle
1:05
transaction this functionality would
1:07
provide users with a really easy way to
1:08
approaches protection at the point of
1:10
deposit so each depit is uh deposit is
1:13
covered
1:14
automatically we're also looking for um
1:17
a team to help us with hackathon
1:20
incentives so we're looking for someone
1:22
to design a hackathon incentives program
1:24
for us the available funding for this
1:25
grant is up to 50,000 um we're looking
1:29
for an individual or small team to
1:30
create or sponsor hackathons that bring
1:33
together talented solidity developers to
1:35
solve problems build new features and
1:37
find ways to improve the Nexus Mutual
1:38
protocol these hackathons should act as
1:41
a funnel for hiring or partnering on
1:43
ecosystem projects um another RFP that's
1:46
pretty high on the priority list is um
1:49
an incentive distribution contract for
1:50
staking pools available funding for this
1:53
is up to 15,000 um we're looking for an
1:56
individual or team to develop a smart
1:58
contract that gives staking pool manager
2:00
the ability to add token incentives to
2:02
their pool this helps with the cold
2:04
start problem when somebody launches a
2:06
new pool and wants to attract Capital
2:08
these incentives should be distributed
2:10
to the individual nxm stakers who have
2:12
allocated Capital into a given pool the
2:14
final deliverable should be production
2:16
ready code that can be audited and
2:18
connected to an individual staking pool
2:20
um this is a relatively simple contract
2:23
but something that would be nice for
2:24
someone to develop that we can bolt on
2:26
to these existing staking pools we're
2:29
also looking for somebody to help us
2:30
with uh our broker sales and product
2:33
package funding for this is up to 10,000
2:36
and we're looking for somebody that has
2:37
experienc creating Brokers packages in
2:39
the past to create a compelling package
2:41
for uh Brokers or people that want to
2:43
help us distribute coverage this can
2:45
serve as the standard package used to
2:47
onboard the next 100 Brokers over the
2:49
next several
2:50
years um some grants that we have that
2:53
have higher available budgets so both of
2:56
these have up to $100,000 available for
2:59
for them one of them is a defi
3:01
integrated wallet solution so somebody
3:03
that can build a solution that would
3:05
allow wallets centralized exchanges and
3:07
aggregators to natively integrate Nexus
3:09
Mutual coverage into their interfaces
3:11
and allow their users to purchase
3:13
protection um through at at the
3:16
transaction layer when they're looking
3:17
to deposit um you would have something
3:19
that would prompt you directly in a
3:21
wallet uh the other one is licensed
3:23
Insurance research so we're looking for
3:26
um somebody with legal expertise to
3:28
conduct research to ident ify how a
3:30
third party operating as a Syndicate can
3:32
become licensed and offer insurance
3:33
without requiring the mutual to move
3:36
capital offchain or convert Capital into
3:38
Fiat if the outcome of that Research
3:40
indicates that it is impossible for a
3:42
Syndicate to become licensed then we
3:44
would expect that report to include uh
3:46
the changes that would be required to
3:47
allow a Syndicate to become licensed so
3:50
again these are a selection of the
3:52
highest priority grants but we have
3:54
other rfps on the grants page as well
3:56
we're also looking for Grant application
3:58
ideas that are outside of the existing
4:00
rfps we have just as long as they fit
4:02
within our current priorities so if you
4:04
have an idea if you would like to build
4:05
on top of the mutual or if you have
4:07
something that fits into our current
4:08
priorities and you'd like to seek a
4:09
grant check out that page on the Dow
