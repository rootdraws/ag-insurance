hey everyone welcome to this week's di po SP great to have we dive into the
0:13
pulse of what's buzzing in di here is what's on today's agenda Ren new D5 will
0:20
walkus through the latest insights from yield opportunities to key risk transs shaping the space few will share
0:27
Foundation updates from the Nexus Mutual team including our exciting new partnership with uro Andi or Mutual is
0:34
stepping up to underr a real world risk and to cover for more boundary types of
0:40
as part of the NEX Mutual 101 series I'll cover the mutual golden partnership ecosystem and how it strengthens our
0:47
mission and don't forget there's a co-op waiting for you at the end let's get started great take it away what's new in

D5
1:00
good morning everybody thanks Sam yeah so there's been a lot of
1:05
excitement in the market since we caught up on our last call eth is up 15% the last couple of weeks and funding rates
1:12
currently are ranging between 20% and 70% in offchain and onchain markets
1:18
Athena's ssde which is a tokenized yield bearing synthetic dollar that makes the
1:23
basis trade accessible and composable in defi um ssde is currently offering 29%
1:29
apy stakers for the most part that represents the average funding rate across all markets since Athena manages
1:35
the underlying assets deposited into their protocol across the major derivatives markets to secure this yield
1:42
so we're seeing more inflows on chain and yields continue to pick up steam so let's take a look at some of those
1:48
Benchmark rates from vault's FYI the USD Benchmark rate currently
1:53
stands at 10.66% apy it's up over 99%
1:58
over the last 30 days The eth Benchmark rate is the same as it's been over the last 30 days
2:05
2.87% API this is essentially the E staking apy that gets tracked over time
2:11
so we're seeing a big push for USD Benchmark rates uh you know 30 days ago
2:17
it was in the 5% range it was in the 5% range largely speaking between four and
2:22
5% for the last several months but now that we've seen such an increase in
2:28
demand for leverage we are seeing uh you know just an increase across the board
2:35
for for uh USD lending and there's a lot of USD yield
2:41
opportunities but looking at lending markets and yield bearing stable coins
2:46
we've seen a lot of rate increases since those onchain yields are starting to increase it's been a catalyst for rate
2:52
increases across lending markets and we've seen some hikes for some of those yield bearing stable coins we talk about
2:58
all the time like the sky savings rate the die savings rate and some others that we'll cover so looking at lending
3:05
markets Sky protocol for maker they increased their stability fees 1% across
3:10
their vaults and increased the die borrow rate on spark protocol to match the current Sky savings rate which is
3:16
now 99.5% a has seen tremendous growth in yields over the last month as well
3:21
stable coin yields for lenders range from 10 to 16% for most markets while
3:26
borrowers have seen rates climb toward uh 10 % across most markets um 10 to 20%
3:34
across most markets and a DA has increased the go borrow rate to 13.31% to match the
3:42
growing Trend across other markets and to help keep go on peg go for a little
3:47
while this month has gone off Peg but it's been rep pegged um essentially due
3:53
to the increase in rates on a uh this trend is also present in a lot of other
3:59
onchain markets as demand for leverage has grown significantly in the current market for yield bearing stable coins
4:05
like I said the sky savings rate saw an increase to 99.5% for ssds holders the
4:11
die savings rat saw an increased to 88.5% for S die holders curve launched
4:16
their savings CRV USD contract which currently offers 15.16 per apy to curve
4:25
USD holders who deposit into that contract so that contract uh takes a percentage of revenue generated in
4:32
curves llama L lending markets and then transfers that to S uh CRV USD holders
4:40
so that's where that yield is coming from and then inverse finances stake DOA or S DOA is earned an average of 12.5%
4:47
apy over the last 30 days while the current apy offered for esto holders is
4:52
about 17% apy so again a lot of uh a lot of demand for leverage a big increasing
5:00
yields so major stable coins um are starting to see more inflows as more
5:05
people are bringing money on chain and looking to earn yield since the gap between treasury rates and onchain rates
5:11
is starting to grow um and there's a pretty big gap between those two looking at circle's USD Supply that's grown by
5:17
2.3% in the last week and tether's USD uh usdt supply has grown by about 3% in
5:25
the last week so again a lot more money starting to come on chain I spoke about the role of Leverage and
5:31
defi in our last call since then I've only seen leverage and onchain markets grow as more people are looking to go
5:37
long on eth and BTC other people are executing looping strategies which we also talked about last week so that's
5:44
where someone deposits one asset is collateral they borrow another asset they swap that asset into that
5:50
collateral asset and they redeposit that um on the collateral side and they
5:55
continue to borrow so they can use that strategy to leverage up on their collateral asset so this looping
6:02
strategy has been very popular for Athena's Sude so like I mentioned um ssde
6:08
tokenizes the basis trade and that has been earning um Sude holders
6:15
29% uh over the last week that's what the current apy is if you look in Athena's UI so because of that people
6:23
are basically borrowing Stables like usdt and usdc and then swapping that for
6:28
USD and staking it to amplify their yields um on Athena so given the amount
6:37
of demand for this we've seen Sude listed on a lot of major lending markets and just two weeks ago it was listed on
6:43
a which is the biggest lending Market in defi so they started out with some initial Supply caps which were hit
6:49
almost immediately I think when they first listed ssde um the supply caps were hit within
6:56
like one block of it going live so just tremendous demand they've increased that the supply caps
7:02
uh currently sit at 512 million sde and those caps have been hit so it's
7:08
100% utilized so it's very likely that a is going to increase the supply caps again since susd has been driving demand
7:15
for borrows across other stable coin markets within a and users are borrowing
7:22
stable coins like I said to leverage up on Sude to increase the yield of
7:27
earning so if you're looking at the difference between um the two so you earn 29% apy with ssde you can borrow
7:35
stable coins between for between 10 to 16% that still leaves plenty of room for Traders to profit so in turn a is seeing
7:43
their revenue grow significantly what tends to happen in these markets though is that in onchain
7:48
markets yields tend to converge um to prevent Arbitrage from completely wi
7:54
wiping out One Lending Market versus another so that's why you're going to see interest rates and yield rates
7:59
continue to rise if demand for leverage continues um as it has over the last month that's why again those rate
8:06
Heights we talked about um that's because there's just been a lot more demand and you're seeing people
8:12
adjusting some of the lending parameters across like compound a some of these
8:17
major lending protocols so as USD denominated yields climb higher um and
8:22
that like I said that gap between US Treasury yields and onchain yields expands we can expect to see more funds
8:28
flow onchain uh if you keep track of you know the alerts where there's like a billion usdt or a billion usdc minted um
8:36
we've seen a lot of those here in the last couple of weeks but looking at onchain yields um I'll go over some
8:42
notable onchain yields that I found in my research this week but be sure to do your own research and determine what is
8:48
suitable for your own risk profile looking at some of the protocols we have in the Bas defi pass Arcadia Finance uh
8:56
for usdc lenders there's been a lot of demand for or leverage Farmers that uh
9:02
you know are farming yields on Aerodrome and Unis swap through Aria finance and because of that the apy for usdc lenders
9:09
has been astronomical here over the last several weeks so right now usdc lenders
9:14
can earn 26% apy uh by lending on Arcadia Finance it's been consistently
9:21
High I think over the last seven days it's been about 22% API but again
9:26
Arcadia Finance as they've grown and as is increased uh in their protocol that
9:32
apy for usdc lenders has been consistently High looking at extra Finance on base usdc lenders uh there
9:40
are a couple usdc lending markets in one market usdc lenders can earn about 177%
9:46
apy while another Market offers 11% apy plus another 6.5% apy in extra token
9:53
rewards looking at eth lenders on extra Finance on base you can earn between uh
9:59
about 4.6% to 5.2% apy on your eth if
10:05
you lend it in extra Finance on base overnight Finance um looking at their
10:10
USD plus token on base holders can earn 133% API but for overnight Finance on
10:17
arbitrum USD plus holders can earn 46% plus apy right now of the yield on
10:23
arbitrum has been very very high as well BP Finance has some great vaults on B B
10:29
and on mainnet um of course they have a lot of other chains but some of the yields I picked out on base the tbtc CB
10:37
BTC Vault um that is managed using the cow swap liquidity manager that's
10:44
earning about 177% apy on Aerodrome the CV eth and eth LP on alien base through
10:52
beefy that's earning 18% apy for some of the stable coin vaults DOA USD C SLP
11:00
pair on Aerodrome is earning 20% apy while the usdc USD LP on Aerodrome is
11:07
earning 177% apy on base looking at some of the BP Finance vaults on mayet the
11:14
curve USD uh llama land vault is earning 50% apy so that's where you deposit your
11:21
CRV USD into that Vault and that is Lent out to one particular llama lend lending
11:28
Market um the apy has been consistently High there as well so you can put that into that Vault and then um B is going to
11:37
Auto compound your rewards which are a blend of uh CRV USD rewards and then
11:44
some CRV token rewards as well and then there are two for FX USD so the DOA FX
11:51
USD curve vault is earning 47% apy and the go CRV USD curve vault is earning 40
11:59
4% apy uh all three of those I just talked about are on Main net so the gas f are a little bit higher but the yield
12:06
has been consistently high in those vaults as well looking at Morpho there's actually quite a few Morpho vaults on
12:12
both base and mainnet where you can earn between 15 to 29%
12:17
apy um on stable coins that's a combination of Base lending rates and
12:22
moreful token rewards hyper liquid has been talked about quite a lot because of their airdrop but there's been a lot of
12:29
trading activity on hyper liquid which is more of like a derivatives protocol so there are a few ways that you can do
12:36
it you can provide some liquidity in the hyper liquid um provider Vault The hlp
12:41
Vault that does come with uh some risk of Market movements and everything but
12:46
um depositors in that Vault deposit usdc are earning about 21% apy depositors and
12:53
other user volets are earning pretty large outsized yields in the triple digits but again that comes with Market
12:58
risk um you can go into the hyper liquid UI and check that out and of course we have protocol cover available for smart
13:05
contract risks on Unis swap B3 uh there are a couple pairs USD usdc in the uh
13:14
0.01% LP that's been earning about 93% apy over the last month and is currently
13:20
earning 260% apy um that's on mainnet there's been a lot of demand there the
13:26
go usdc 0.05 5% LP uh this is earned 31%
13:32
over the last 30 days and is currently earning 85% apy and again that one's also on Main net looking at pancake swap
13:39
um on base the DOA usdc pair in the 0.25% lp has earned 156% apy over the
13:47
last month and is currently earning 217% apy and then the last ones I'll look at
13:52
are on pendall um pendall on mainnet has three markets they're all stable coin
13:57
markets they all have 113-day maturities so sde is earning 22.87% fixed yield
14:05
over the next 113 days usde is earning
14:10
22.67% fixed yield over the next 113 days and SDS is earning 12.16% fixed yield over
14:19
the next 113 days so a lot of very high yields on stable coins some high yields
14:24
on eth as well of course there's a lot of other opportunities out there you can at Vault FYI for some yield
14:31
opportunities and defi llama is yields page as well um there's a lot of great places to look for yields there but
14:37
those are just some of the notable yields that I've pointed out all of these protocols I've talked about we have coverage for um the ones that are
14:43
on base we have the base defi pass which is flexible coverage so you can move
14:49
your funds between Aerodrome Arcadia beefy compound V3 extra Finance moonwell
14:55
Moro overnight and Unis swap V3 on base you can move your funds between those protocols uh we cover the underlying
15:02
subprotocols underneath these protocols as well so you can move your funds
15:07
between those protocols while maintaining your protection up to the covered amount so with yields in the 15
15:12
to 20% range across those covered protocols with some opportunities that are higher it's a great time to earn
15:18
yield on base and protect yourself against smart contract and economic risks you're going to learn more about that on opencover if you go to their
15:25
site open cover.com um and you can find the B defi pass they have a lot of great information about it
15:31
uh and everything of course you can always ask questions on Discord or you can ask us here on Twitter if anybody
15:37
has any questions about the Bas T by pass feel free to raise your hand and uh
15:42
I'll call you up on stage otherwise I will go through some governance updates so we're working to
15:48
put nmip 243 on Shan today and this proposal outlines pricing parameter
15:54
changes and added pricing functionality for fixed price public listings this proposal is related to some new
16:01
products we have in development while uh one product is nearing the soft launch stage I have proposed that members Grant
16:08
The Advisory Board the power to decrease the price bump ratio parameter from 20 to five to reduce the rate at which a
16:15
listings price increases after a cover buy to remove surge pricing from the protocol's existing price
16:21
calculations to change the global Min price to the default Min price and that would stay at 1% and then create
16:28
functionality to set a minimum price at the listing level which we'll call the listing Min
16:33
price and then we would create functionality for public fixed price listings that any mo pool manager can
16:39
stake against with that Min price the listing level you can create a public listing that has a like a floor price so
16:46
that it's not aise to the bottom so with all of these changes we will be allowed
16:51
to um or will be able to provide users with a better cover buying experience we can reduce pricing for some battle
16:57
tested listings and remain competitive on certain product types like e slashing while supporting new product development
17:03
so once this onchain proposal is up we'll put out some announcements but the Voting is going to be open for three
17:09
days members are going to be voting again on whether or not to Grant the ab the authority to make these changes once
17:16
the engineering team finalizes each individual product and has it ready to push to production members who vote on
17:22
this proposal are also going to receive a proportional share of 100 nxm and incentives based on the number of people
17:28
who vote this incentive is there to cover gas costs for people who participate in onchain voting so be sure
17:34
to review the proposal and participate in the vote this week any questions on the onchain proposal before we move
17:44
on okay if not I'll turn things over to Hugh to give the foundation update and
17:49
talk about some of our recent product announcements that we have you
18:17
I still see Hugh as a listener whereas he should have been a speaker so I
18:22
wonder if yeah I've invited you to speak so he should be able to come up on the stage and speak okay okay okay
19:02
all right good thank you got it sorted out now um cool um hey everyone
19:09
um thanks for for having me on Lee and everyone um Al righty so Foundation
19:14
update sorry doing a million things at once and now we got the speaker sorted so now I'll get my head back on track um
19:20
okay so yeah Foundation update um lot of really cool things happening especially on the on the product side um so you may
19:26
have seen just um a little while ago that um we just re announced the um
19:32
immuni bug Bounty coverage product um so this is um a new product we've just
19:37
launched um today with with immuni um and the idea here is that um projects
19:44
that want to offer bug Bounty services so where white hats um look at the code and if they find um a bounty in the Life
19:50
code they can earn a reward a bounty um the the idea here is that the the bigger
19:57
bounties that you can offer um the more white hats can um will look and are
20:02
interested in looking at the code and um and finding potential bugs and so the more secure your code is um but often
20:08
you need to to list quite a high bounty to attract um the best white hats and so
20:15
therefore the project um has uncertainty on what the cash flow might be and if they can afford that type of bounty or
20:21
not um so what we've offered what we come up with this new product for is basically um a product which will cover
20:28
80% of the critical bug Bounty payment um up to 80% of the the Bounty payment
20:33
and so it allows the projects to have much more certainty um around what the costs are going to be and and how that's
20:39
going to work so um this is a project specifically for projects um in the space that have have bug banding
20:45
programs on immuni um and hopefully the the idea is we'll um end up creating a
20:50
much more safer and secure um D5 for everyone because hopefully the bugs we found before there are hacks um so yeah
20:57
it's a it's really hopefully I think it's an exciting product we've had a lot of requests for this type of thing um and excited to work with MiFi
21:05
on this one I think they're probably got the largest bug boundy program um in depi so um so hopefully they're going to
21:11
be rolling it out to a bunch of their projects and um seeing who is going to be interested in taking this up and we've got some really um solid inbounds
21:18
so far so really excited by that one um and hopefully we'll see some some cover sales coming in over the month and into
21:25
the new year so so it's pretty cool um that's kind of the first one um the
21:30
second one um we do have a a new product that we're planning to launch before
21:36
before Christmas so um hopefully we will get that um get that ship soon I won't say much more about it right now but um
21:43
but it's pretty exciting and we also have a bunch of other um deals coming up
21:50
um in the in the near future as well hopefully some of them will close in in December but um but some probably also
21:57
close in Jan so there's there's a lot of potential deals happening here and some of them are kind of real world deals um one one
22:05
item I did want to go into a bit more was the insur deal um so insur is a uh
22:13
regulated BMA regulated so bermudan regulated um insurance company they
22:19
provide um coverage or Insurance to um various programs such things like flight
22:24
delay or other guarantee type products and things like that so they have a panel of like six or seven different
22:30
clients there that are um that they're covering like a whole range of different users underneath that um and what we've
22:38
done here is effectively insurer has offloaded risk into Nexus and so we're kind of acting like a reinsurer in a lot
22:44
way so we're covering um Nexus is covering um the insurer pools um and I
22:49
think that's I think that's very interesting because it's basically another instance of a regulated Insurance entity offloading risk into um
22:57
into next as the um Insurance alternative the defi Insurance alternative um and so I think it's a
23:04
really interesting way of deploying uh crypto Capital um against Real World risks and and getting that
23:11
bridge into the real world so there's I think there's a lot of this is I would describe it as kind of a a pilot that
23:17
we're very hoping and hopeful to build upon um and expand further so we're now
23:23
working with the insur team on how we can increase um this kind of partnership and cover more of of the risk an insur
23:29
writing um so but we started small get getting something live first um as kind of an MVP and then um we'll look to to
23:36
expand it so this this one's pretty cool as well um again covering some some like non- crypto risks um which is which is
23:43
cool and to me is an indication of kind of how flexible um the the Nexus
23:49
platform is about what it can do I mean we've got the platform we've got the capital and now we're looking to expand
23:54
it and cover a whole bunch of things within crypto um and and be on so so I
24:00
think that's a really that's a really cool partnership um and we've got a lot of um people that are inbound off the
24:05
back of those announcements um back at the insure announcements about oh that's pretty interesting how can we
24:11
potentially work with you as well on on that top St so I think in general if you think at a very high strategic type
24:17
level there's a whole bunch of um risk looking for a home and there's a whole
24:22
lnch of capital within defi that um can be deployed more effectively and working
24:28
out how to create the bridges but to connect those two um is the tricky part but um but and we've started with some
24:34
Pilots been doing a whole bunch of different things there but looking to scale it up and make it even bigger so
24:39
um I think there's a I think there's a very strong um case to to grow this um
24:46
as far because it feels like the the market um Dynamics are really suited
24:51
like you've we've got the we've got the people who want to buy the cover we've got the capital that wants to deploy against it and we have to work out how
24:58
to conect the dots in the most efficient way possible so we're working that out at the moment and um I think there's a
25:04
lot of potential there so that's pretty exciting too um I guess more
25:09
specifically on um protocol um type stuff as um Brave mentioned there's a
25:15
whole bunch of pricing changes we're looking to put on chain governance proposal today um which would um
25:21
hopefully help us out in a lot of different ways so i' i' consider them a whole bunch of different tweaks but
25:26
they're all very um they're all being made off the back of solid tangible
25:31
feedback from users Etc and products that um that we can enable so um I think a lot of them are going to be very
25:37
useful um as we expand out the product set and um distribution options um so that that's that's going
25:45
well as well um we're also I'm sure people would be glad to hear this we're also just doing um just
25:52
started fully um our internal testing of the staking UI um our next version of
25:58
the UI so um it's been a while coming it's definitely been quite complicated to pull it all together there's a lot of
26:03
data in there behind the scenes um but um but that's coming quite soon um so
26:08
I'm be excited to get that out to to everyone as well um it looks really cool it's got some some nice features and
26:14
definitely be good to transition this the staking part onto the the new look and feel of the the app so um so that's
26:21
really cool and and I guess um I guess it's really just more
26:27
generally it's really good to see the the increase traction that we're getting um especially over the last couple of
26:32
weeks cover amounts have increased um a good chunk um we've got a big funds renewing all the covers um and there's
26:41
definitely an uptick in I guess a wider user base um buying coverage on on a
26:47
whole bunch of different things um and one in particular the the base defi passes has seems to be growing in
26:53
popularity there um it's definitely get some solid cover buyers quite regularly
26:58
on it um and I think it's nice to see that as a as a flexible um option um for
27:04
PE for people looking to to deploy in defi across a variety of different protocols um I think that's a really
27:09
good product so I'm looking to build on that as well so I guess lots of
27:15
different things going on now um lots of potential um products lots of potential
27:22
distribution options and also a lot more inbound from funds and I guess the institutions within the space looking
27:28
for coverage um and that are reconnecting now that um I guess um
27:34
we've had there obviously the pric is going up and there's a bit more interest in general about allocating to Defi and
27:39
crypto so um the direction of travel is really positive and really excited to get to see the product announcements
27:45
we've had over the past few weeks and also the new ones we've got lined up um over the coming weeks and and into next
27:51
year so yeah feeling really positive about a whole bunch of things right now um yeah happy to take questions on on
27:57
any all of
28:10
that thank you Hugh thank you Brave I'd like to talk about the last week in
28:16
numbers and maybe even talk about the month uh in sales as Hugh just pointed
28:23
out we had a good month overall and let's look at the sum of let's look at
28:29
some of the top performing products first off in November the
28:34
mutual sold over 98.1 million in cover with members
28:40
earning more than 555,000 in premiums among the top performing
28:47
products of the month is avv V3 protocol cover leading the way the IG layer and
28:54
ether by bundled protocol cover followed closely the top 10 list also features protocol
29:01
covers for more fo bolts IP liquids and Pendle excitingly the newly introduced
29:08
