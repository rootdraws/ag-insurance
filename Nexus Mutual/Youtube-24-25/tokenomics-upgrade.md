good morning everybody uh in this
0:02
section I'll provide an overview of the
0:03
Rams launch and performance to date so
0:06
we'll get started on the next
0:11
slide so after months of parameter
0:13
discussions solidity development and
0:16
Audits and governance
0:18
discussions n mpip 209 went up for vote
0:21
on the 15th of November voting was open
0:24
for 3 days and members voted with more
0:25
than
0:26
1.18 million nxm to unanimously approve
0:31
nmip 209 so a few days later the ram was
0:35
launched on Tuesday the 21st of November
0:38
when the ram launched it replaced a
0:39
bonding curve it also removed the MCR
0:42
floor which also eliminated the MCR lock
0:46
that was preventing members from
0:47
redeeming their nxm for Ethan in the
0:49
first place so for those of you who
0:52
aren't familiar with how the Ram works
0:53
for what the ram
0:55
is the ram is made up of two virtual
0:59
one-sided un swap V2 um pools and those
1:03
pools determine the price at which the
1:06
mutual is willing to buy and sell nxm in
1:09
value of creative ranges for the mutual
1:11
this is also complemented by a price
1:13
ratchet that enables price Discovery the
1:17
Below Pool and above pool are the two
1:18
pools present in the system these pools
1:21
contain a defined amount of eth
1:23
liquidity paired with virtual nxm this
1:25
creates two internal pools which have
1:27
the same eth liquidity the nxm reserves
1:30
in each pool are represented by a
1:32
virtual nxm balance the ethn nxm
1:35
balances change over time as nxm is sold
1:38
and purchased you can learn more about
1:40
the RAM and the updated token model in
1:43
the Nexus Mutual
1:45
documentation I'll move on to the next
1:48
slide but now that the ram is Live
1:50
members can redeem nxm for eth right in
1:53
the Nexus Mutual user interface under
1:56
the nxm
1:57
section so on that page you can redeem
2:00
your nxm for eth there's also an option
2:03
to unwrap any W nxm to
2:06
nxm while we Endeavor to provide a safe
2:09
and userfriendly user interface for the
2:10
benefit of members it is essential to
2:13
point out and emphasize that the
2:15
underlying smart contract governing wxm
2:18
is not associated with nxm and Nexus
2:21
Mutual this's a smart contract that was
2:24
developed by a third party and is
2:26
entirely separate from Nexus Mutual just
2:29
be sure to to do some due diligence and
2:31
use caution there's a disclaimer on that
2:33
page that has a little bit more
2:35
information that you could check out as
2:36
well but you can learn more about the
2:39
ram security and how members can redeem
2:41
at exm for eth in the blog post on our
2:46
website which you can find in
2:49
the in the banner on the website and in
2:51
the banner in the
2:53
UI I will move on to the next
2:57
slide before I jump into an overview of
2:59
the r performance I wanted to cover what
3:01
the goals of the tokenomics revamp
3:04
project are as set out in the ratcheting
3:06
amm white paper so now that the uh the
3:09
ram is launched the goal of the system
3:10
is to bring the price of nxm used by the
3:13
system and the open market price
3:15
together again allow members who wish to
3:17
exit to do so directly from the protocol
3:19
at a reasonable price allow the protocol
3:21
to capture Capital when members wish to
3:24
provide it and create positive value for
3:26
long-term align members with that in
3:29
mind let's go over the Rams performance
3:31
to
3:34
dat so the ram launched two weeks ago
3:36
and numbers had been redeeming since the
3:38
ratchet first moved the price close to
3:41
book value on Wednesday the 22nd of
3:43
November today
3:46
86922 3 nxm have been redeemed for
3:51
17377 eth which is roughly
3:55
39.5% of the initial budget allocated
3:58
for the the initial exit
4:02
period the initial exit period will be
4:04
active until the remaining eth in the
4:06
initial budget is exhausted and there's
4:08
still another 27 or
4:11
26,7 six eth left in the initial budget
4:15
which is the remaining
4:17
60.5% so if you're looking for some
4:20
updates on the Rams performance there
4:23
are two really great Dune dashboards
4:25
that people can check out to stay up to
4:26
date there is the Nexus Mutual
4:28
ratcheting amm dashboard which created
4:31
which was created by the R&D team and
4:34
the nxm dashboard that was created by
4:36
Richard Chen so there's been discussion
4:39
on the Forum as well about potentially
4:40
updating some of the Rams parameters if
4:43
you haven't already reviewed that post
4:44
you can find it on the NEX Mutual
4:45
governance
4:46
Forum um but for the most part that
4:49
concludes my review of The Ram um the
4:52
launch and the performance I'm happy to
4:54
take any questions if anybody has any
4:56
before we move
4:58
on if there are no
5:01
questions then I will hand things off to
5:03
Hugh to review the cover repr proposal
5:05
on the governance Forum Hugh
