[Music] welcome everybody to this week's
0:09
bi-weekly Community call we hold our community calls every other week on X at
0:15
11: a.m. eastern and 3M UTC We Gather to talk about the state of
0:21
defi in risks and yields um have some of the team updates delivered from Hugh
0:28
himself and also highlight whatever is new in our community
Agenda
0:34
welcome today we're going to talk a little about the state of defi Brave
0:40
publishes reports on the state of defi every week and they are really useful we're going to go over some of the
0:46
recent developments and then we'll hear from Brave again about the latest protocol
0:52
cover listings and get some more highlights about our ecosystem partners and some new products like the bundle uh
1:00
protocol cover which has uh which has been quite successful the past two weeks
1:05
and then we'll hear from Hugh with Foundation team updates have some more
1:10
announcements and before we open up the open uh forum for any uh Community
1:17
questions I'll shortly give more details about the PO app and how to receive
BraveNewDeFi's State of DeFi Yields Report
1:25
it all right let's go then um Brave how is the state of of Def these
1:31
days yeah so I am brave new defi I'm speaking from the Nexus account but um I
1:37
am the head of community and I manage things on the product side within Nexus and like seit said I write the state of
1:45
defi yields report and publish that on mirror every week um I finishing up the
1:50
report for today uh since I was off yesterday for the holiday um just getting that up and getting that ready
1:57
so uh as far as d yields go and just kind of like the General market sentiment uh we're still very much in a
2:04
sideways market we've seen eth uh decline about like eight I think it's
2:10
88.6% here over the last seven days um funding rates have come down we saw an
2:17
initial Spike on E funding rates last week but they've kind of leveled down so I think the sentiment is settling a
2:24
little bit but there's still quite a few um yield opportunities out there in def5
2:30
um a lot of those are being powered by the Athena shards campaign um yields on
2:38
susd and on the yields for uh eth in gearbox and the liquid reaking token
2:45
strategies through Pendle um and the other points farming strategies so there's still a lot happening on that
2:52
side I think one of the bigger topics of discussion this week which I'll rot Pew
2:58
into and get his opinion is about um Maker's recent deployment of funds into
3:06
aoral blue market so spark Dow which is a subd within maker um initially
3:12
deployed 100 million die into a lending Market they created within Moro blue
3:17
which is a permissionless lending Market um that the moro team has built uh it's
3:23
relatively simple I think it's 600 lines of code but there's a lot of optionality
3:29
that people have in setting up permissionless lending markets what sparkd Dow has done is they've created
3:34
the market between D and usde and then die in ssde um they put 100 Mil in last week in
3:42
D it's basically fully utilized and is printing money for maker da so they have
3:49
a proposal on the Forum to up the uh the die coming from the direct die module um
3:57
into maker Dow are into maker Dow's morphol blue markets um so they're
4:04
upping that to 600 million with the total potential to be a billion die
4:09
which is a very large portion of the the die Supply so there have been a lot of people that have kind of raised concerns
4:16
about this um the added risk for die holders and whether or not this is a
4:22
prudent um prudent allocation of funds um from my perspective I recently this
4:28
morning just respond responded to uh llama on the brink who is active with ins synthetics and has a lot of takes um
4:36
about Defi and the ethereum ecosystem on a whole um and just talked about you
4:42
know the change in Risk appetite for maker this kind of fits in with their
4:47
their endgame plan but it definitely is a little alarming to see not just maker but so many other protocols integrate um
4:56
usde and ssde throughout defi um so from my perspective it's just
5:02
worrying to see something that launched two months ago not even quite two months ago um and have that is collateral
5:10
integrated everywhere considering that Athena in my mind is is a CI product you know it's funds that are held in a multi
5:17
computational or multi-party computational wallets and then there's a delta neutral strategy being run on
5:22
centralized exchanges um and really the only smart contract portion of it is the
5:28
deposit contract which you put funds in um and then the ssde staking contract
5:34
where yield is directed um so I think this does definitely add risk for maker
5:40
holders I don't know if it's as much as others are um saying but there there
5:47
definitely are some liquidity issues uh at scale if this is Unwound but um PE
5:53
I'd like to kind of get your thoughts on on this added exposure um for die holders to USD and SD and more broadly I
6:01
guess Athena's integration across defi yeah um this one's a really tricky
6:07
one um I I I mean I'm still trying to catch up and make sure I understand all everything what's going on but I think
6:14
the the first thing is AA usdc with USD doesn't
6:20
um it doesn't seem as risky as I initially thought and so you know there's definitely some um I think some
6:28
people are viewing it the perhaps a bit too negatively on the on the wrist side in general but I I do think the one
6:34
thing that um is untested at the moment is how quickly it's growing in the scale that it's got to so quickly like I I
6:40
think in general I like to see things grow a bit more slowly and be a bit more battle tested before they get huge um
6:45
but this one's kind of gone straight to being huge and so you know if if something does go wrong because there's
6:51
such a large proportion of the open interest and stuff then then it can um mean bigger problems I think so I think
6:58
there's just one thing to worry about just about just how fast it is growing um but um in terms of like the
7:04
interaction with dy I I really do have to get into this in a bit more um detail
7:10
and you know I think it's one of those things again that it's if it's smaller and it starts and then it grows and you
7:16
kind of stand it a bit more then I feel a lot more comfortable than if you just um go big straight away um so you
7:24
know I think I think that concern here is that everything is moving extremely quickly um so it feels like someone's
7:30
going to miss something um and you know because it's moving so quickly a whole bunch of people tend to make some
7:36
assumptions about how things work and the when when stuff goes wrong it often goes wrong because someone doing one
7:42
thing miscommunicate or misinterprets what another person's supposed to be doing or what they thought they were supposed to be doing and there's a um
7:49
issue there with the people involved and because it's because there aren't always smart contracts and this stuff it's um a
7:55
lot of it's runoff chain then you know there's I think um there's more opportunity for that to happen um so
8:01
yeah I think just I think it's just generally the speed and the scale of which things are happening does cause me some concern at the moment um but to me
8:08
there isn't like to me there isn't a massive obvious thing that you're like oh that that could be a really big problem if it gets big so you know I
8:15
still want to get into more detail but that's that's my initial thoughts at this stage yeah I would I I tend to agree I I
8:23
think that the risks broadly speaking with it being integrated everywhere especially across Ling markets is more
8:29
liquidity is there sufficient liquidity to unwind um loans within the lending
8:34
Market you know if something were to happen if things are primarily stable coin to stable coin then you know that
8:41
risk is is not as as high but again it depends on what the parameters are um
8:47
and what the situation looks like if there's like a a big Cascade in uh usde D pegs even though it's it's not
8:55
really a stable coin they they Market it as a synthetic dollar but um
9:00
the only thing that holds the peg is essentially uh Arbitrage between that and redemptions
9:06
but to be able to redeem it you would need to be a kyc member within uh within Athena but uh but yeah um I'll talk
9:12
about that more in my state of defi yields reports uh I have some thoughts there I've also shared some on Twitter
9:19
that you can check out but I definitely I think it's definitely something for Mutual members to think about and
9:25
consider um I think one of the things that I'll do is put up a proposal on the Forum to add usdc um to the capital pool
9:33
I'll put up that initial RFC later this week so that there's an option for people who are don't want to be exposed
9:40
to that risk when they're buying cover they can just buy cover in usdc um just adding another option to the capital
9:46
pool as well but um as far as yields go you know I think we're still seeing some
9:52
pretty significant opportunities on gearbox um and and pendall I think that's where some of the the larger
9:59
opportunities are there are also some within uh FX protocol which is a stable
10:06
coin protocol um they have a few other different products within there but what
10:11
they're doing right now is using fxn their native token to incentivize liquidity with other decentralized
10:17
stable coins and and other stable coin pairs um and so because of that they basically have a gauge and through
10:23
convex you know there's relatively high yields I'll have that in my state defi yield report as well we've also got bundled protocol cover for that which
10:31
I've seen a few people buy here in the last week as more people um are checking out that
10:37
strategy and yeah on on Pendle we've seen a lot of cover buys for the bundle
10:43
protocol cover which I'll talk a little bit more about when we get to listings um we've seen a lot of cover buys come through for that so there's a lot of
10:50
people allocating um liquidity taking tokens like ether e eth um RS eth from
10:58
kelp RSW eth swell and easy eth from Renzo uh gearbox on the eth side it's
11:05
still I think 25% variable apy and their passive earned lending markets um I think on
11:12
pendall the rates are somewhere between 30 and 60% for fixed deals for liquidity
11:19
um for the uh principal tokens and yield tokens I think it's uh you know on on
11:25
the higher side um so there's definitely still a lot of yield opportunities out for both stable coins and eth and a lot
11:32
of this is primarily being fueled by the uh the points Mania across Athena and
11:38
some of these liquid reaking protocols so um yeah still a lot of people
11:44
deploying capital in defi still a lot of yield opportunities even if things have cooled a bit for the week I think as we
11:51
go through April it'll still be my personal opinion is it'll be a sideways Market um and everything I think
11:57
everyone's still banking on this uh this eth spot ETF but we'll see what
12:04
happens there I guess in May at some point um but yeah so I think things are still holding steady lots of yields out
12:10
there um but we've gotten some requests for some new listings which we've put up
New Cover Listings
12:17
in the next Mutual UI and as far as bundle protocol cover listings we've added quite a few here in the last
12:24
couple weeks so we initially added a bundle protocol cover product for ether
12:29
um on Pendle which covers igen layer ether and Pendle um we saw pretty
12:35
substantial amount of demand for that people have bought that I think the price is still high on that one uh we
12:41
also added uh per some members requests um a kelp bundle for Pendle um a swell
12:48
bundle for Pendle and a Renzo bundle for Pendle so all of those cover aan layer Pendle and then those liquid we sticking
12:54
protocols um we've seen pretty substantial demand for those covered products as as well so we're working on
13:00
opening up more capacity and talking with some of the staking pool managers um just because demand there has been so
13:05
significant I've seen people asking for it on Discord as well um and a few people have reached out to me on Twitter
13:10
so um working on talking to some of the other sing pool managers and opening up capacity uh We've also added a bottle
13:18
protocol cover listing for ethery liquid Vault um we announced that last week we're going to have a Twitter spaces
13:24
with them tomorrow uh I'll go over that in a bit more detail here after I get get through some of the listings um like
13:30
I said we have a bundle protocol cover listing for FX protocol curve and convex for their liquidity strategy the urine
13:38
juice vaults um quenta and synthetics beefy and curve beefy and compound V3
13:44
and then beefy balancer V2 and Aura uh all of those listings are up for bundle
13:50
protocol cover as well we just announced the quent and synthetics listing today
13:55
so we have quite a few up if there are any bundle protocol cover list things that you would like to see uh just shoot
14:01
me a message on Twitter or send me a message on Discord and we can definitely
14:06
review that during our next product meeting on the protocol cover side we listed notional V3 they just launched on
14:13
their V3 on eth bainet but they've been live on arbitrum for like six months so
14:18
uh as they're growing liquidity on mainnet and everything there's an option to buy cover there uh if you're doing one of their leverage liquidity or
14:24
leverage Vault strategies on arbitrum you can buy cover to protect your posits there as well we also added a morphol
14:32
blue Market the rep Stak eth and usdc Market um we've added that we'll be
14:37
looking at some other moral blue markets uh in the coming weeks as well and then we also added frax landland protocol
14:45
cover for those who are depositing collateral and borrowing Frack or people that are Prov um supplying fracks to fra
14:52
lender earn yield so um we'll be adding some more listings uh in you know the
14:58
next week uh in the coming weeks um again if there's bundles that you would like just reach out to me on Discord on
15:04
the open cover side they've announced um some additions to their uh offerings on
OpenCover News
15:10
L2 for those of you who aren't familiar uh open cover is a protocol cover
15:15
distribution platform uh built on L2 so you can buy cover uh without going through kyc on optimism base or
15:24
arbitrum um lower transaction fees same comprehensive cover that we provide here on mainnet they just batch cover buys
15:32
together on mainnet a couple times a day um they added velodrome and then gearbox
15:38
V3 they added both of those listings here in the last couple of weeks uh they're going to be adding some more as well they've got two more listing
15:45
announcements that are coming out tomorrow so keep an eye on the open cover Twitter accounts and then open
15:50
cover also um announced a pretty exciting update last week is that they've been added to uh Lloyds of
15:57
London's lab cooh so uh Lloyds of London is like the
16:02
largest Insurance Market in the world and they are a leading specialist um
16:09
with a long-standing history of of innovation so working within their lab cohort should be able to allow open
16:15
cover to uh expand maybe come with some um cover product ideas of their own and
16:22
continue to build on top of Nexus and help people protect themselves in l2s so
16:28
so keep an eye on open cover I think there's a lot of exciting updates coming in the future for them as well uh on the
Upcoming Community Events
16:35
event side um we've got a couple Twitter spaces events coming up like I said on
16:41
Wednesday at 2 pm Eastern 6 PM UTC we're going to be talking with the ethery team
16:46
about their liquid vaults where people can deposit eth or WRA
16:52
eth and that gets put through some um defi strategies to earn yield people in
16:58
the liquid vaults also earn ethi token rewards and ethery loyalty points as well as Ian layer points we're going to
17:06
be talking with them about the Vault um as well as our bundle protocol cover listing for ethery liquid um we'll be
17:12
talking about a few other things on that spaces as well so be sure to set yourself a reminder uh you can find that
17:18
on the Nexus Mutual Twitter account we can also drop that Below in the comments here in a bit as well um but yeah that
17:25
should be a really good space I'm looking forward to talking with the ethery team and then on Thursday uh April 4th at
17:32
11:00 a.m. eastern or 3 p.m. UTC we're going to be talking with the wall faer Labs team about vaults FYI uh if you're
17:40
not familiar this is the site that I use to get data for the state of defi yield so I base the base rate in defi off of
17:48
the 7-Day average yields that they display on vault FYI it's a really great platform for looking at you know um
17:56
interest rates across Landing markets or just defi yields across different platforms um I'm a really big fan of all
18:02
FYI so we're going to be talking to them about the state of yields within defi Vault FYI some of the other products
18:09
they're building and um their view of the defi ecosystem on ethereum l2s and
18:17
some other networks as well so that should be a really good interview that we have with them as part of our covering defi uh series we'll be talking
18:24
a bit about risk um about what they're building and you know what's happen within defi so I recommend setting a
18:31
reminder and checking that one out as well um yeah I
18:36
think I think that's what I have for my updates I'm gonna pass things over to Hugh to give his update from the
18:43
foundation Hugh cool thanks Brave um yeah a lot of
Team Updates
18:49
things going on that I feel like everything's just picked up a lot recently because the yields are up and um cover buys are up and and there's a
18:55
lot more momentum around things we're getting a lot more inbounds on on very bits and pieces there's quite a few um
19:01
detailed like you know tailed or bespoke coverage um type proposals we're kind of
19:06
working through with with some some different teams so um you know relatively early stages but there's some
19:12
good interesting stuff in there um there's also um looking to build out um
19:18
the syndicates on top of Nexus so these are the you know the people that run the the staking pools but also like distribute coverage and potentially come
19:24
up with new products open cover is a really good one there and um as I've mentioned a few times before they they've got some interesting new
19:30
products that going coming to launch um over the next um month or two um so that's that's pretty cool as well so
19:35
we're helping them with that um coming up with cover wording and that type of thing um so I guess there's a lot of
19:42
things on the um sales and growth and um like BD side of things that that are
19:47
definitely keeping keeping us busy on on the engineering side we're working with
19:53
eify on Integrations that so um that that would be that's pretty exciting um hopefully hear about that um over the
20:00
coming week or two um so yeah there's there's some um we're also I guess working more G to make basically
20:08
condense the cover process something that's a whole lot more simpler for for the end user so um and you know they can
20:15
do that at the point where they're allocating to the yield rather than having to come to next as a site so that's a I think that's going to be
20:21
really powerful um we've got some really um some that's going to be coming in stages and there's some really
20:28
interesting stuff coming combined on the on the product side of things as well as um the technical kind of integration
20:34
side of things so um the engineers working hard on on on that stuff um as well so yeah I feel like um just in
20:41
general there's a whole bunch of different um things going on um in yeah in bounds increasing we're getting a lot
20:47
of um yeah these ad hoc deals but I think more um I think more more in
20:53
general what we're we're also exploring ways to um to basically encourage
20:59
syndicates to to build on top of this in in in more ways and that that can be
21:04
very technical or it can be very more broker is like kind of um you know just more of the pure sales side of thing so
21:10
I guess if anyone is interested in um learning more about that or um has some ideas on that front then please you do
21:16
reach out and I'm get in touch we're also going to be doing some outbound on on that side of things over the coming months as well so yeah um energy and
21:24
everything's just happening at the moment so it's really good to see um especially after um bare market for quite a while but
21:30
yeah um definitely um strong and positive momentum on a number of fronts so yeah happy
21:37
to if if you'd like to if there are no questions to you at
Open Position in DAO
21:42
the moment um Ray why don't you go over our recent position announcement and
21:48
have us uh take a sneak peek into the q1
21:54
report yeah so on the Dow Community team we have an opening that we announced um
22:00
I think it was not last week but the week before so we have an open position for a social media marketing manager um
22:09
within the Dow Community team uh the person that we're looking for is somebody who hopefully is um
22:17
familiar with dii who is an active user within dii and is familiar with some of
22:22
the basic protocols um somebody who's obviously obsessed with social media is
22:28
comfortable posting on Twitter and Linkedin active on Discord is familiar with some of these platforms as well as
22:34
maybe you know some of the nice to have are people that are familiar with farcaster lens some of these new uh
22:40
decentralized social media platforms but you know we're looking for somebody who's got a strong attention to detail
22:46
uh a creative mind a knack for growth strategies and somebody who's really
22:52
passionate about defi so we are trying to find somebody who wants to work with
22:58
the do Community team to help us educate people about protecting themselves with protocol cover bundle protocol cover and
23:05
some of our other cover products um you know we have a lot that's in the pipeline and we want somebody to work
23:12
with us a little bit on strategy but a lot of it on managing postings across our social media channels which um can
23:19
be very timec consuming uh and you know just somebody who can kind of optimize the process and work with us a little
23:25
bit more we have a posting that is up on the governance Forum um and you can
23:32

23:54
uh yeah I mean what we're offering is you know it's a remote work environment um competitive pay with nxm token
24:02
allocation and you be working as part of the Dow Community team so you know we have our budget review process every six
24:08
months um and then you know you get to work with a a blue chip protocol team
24:15
working to make coverage more accessible across defi um and looking to develop
24:20
new products and expand into new markets within crypto um and uh in traditional
24:26
markets as well so I think there's a lot of really exciting things happening with an Nexus and I'm looking forward to working with somebody who is also

24:50
reminder about that job opportunity um from the main Nexus account and my
24:56
personal Twitter account as well so hoping we can find somebody here in the next month um and then I wanted to just
Q1 Report Highlights
25:03
talk a little bit about our q1 insights report we're going to be publishing publishing this on the Nexus Mutual
25:10
governance Forum on Thursday but just some some rough numbers here as we're
25:15
going through and putting it together um we've seen a considerable amount of growth from Q4 to q1 so Q4 2023 to q1
25:25
2024 we've seen uh a 30% % increase in cover sales um in terms of uh premium
25:32
growth we've seen 162% increase in premiums um quarter over quarter and the
25:38
commissions that have gone to the dowo treasury um we've seen over 250% increase in commissions as well um you
25:45
know this is pretty much offsetting the cost of the Dow teams primarily over time um you know so looking at some
25:52
numbers a little over 75 million in total cover sold um about 50k in cover
26:00
fees that have accured in the capital pool uh 1.65 million in investment
26:06
earnings and uh about 1.56 million in um
26:11
buyback value from the the RAM and people are redeeming nxm so across all
26:18
of those you know that's about 3.76 million in value growth to the capital
26:24
pool across those three revenue streams for for the Dow commissions that's
26:33
$715 in commissions that have gone to the Dow treasury um just here in the last quarter a you know a large portion
26:41
of the cover buys that have come through are still protocol cover but with a launch of bundle protocol cover we've
26:46
seen a decent amount of cover buys come through and a significant amount of
26:51
premiums come through for bundle cover so it looks like people are really enjoying the bundle cover and the
26:58
ability to buy one cover nft for um smart contract risk across multiple
27:04
protocols so we're excited to share uh more information in that q1 insights report but you know a really nice start
27:12
to our initiative to grow more cover sales here throughout the year so I think this is just the beginning and
27:19
there's a lot more that we have in uh in the coming quarter that should help us
27:24
increase cover sales increase uh premium growth and um in increase some more commissions
27:32
to the Dow for open covers performance um about 3 million in cover sales in q1
27:39
and 14,000 in cover fees in q1 uh we're already seeing some large cover buys
27:44
coming through open cover here in Q2 and we're off to a very good start in Q2 as
27:51
well but um look for that report on Thursday on the governance Forum we'll send out an announcement but some really
27:58
exciting developments and numbers there as well but I will pass things off to
28:03
Sam to give the update on the last week and cover sales Sam thanks
Last Week in Cover Sales
28:10
Brave looking at the last week in review uh it's uh it was the last week of the
28:17
month March and uh also the last week of
28:23
q1 we sold about $15.4 million of cover and our members
28:31
earned more than 179,000 uh worth of
28:36
premiums our active cover amount jumped from the previous week I think the jump
28:42
was about 30% and um we have seen most of the
28:47
cover buys through bundled protocol cover like Brave had highlighted we will
28:53
have a section in the uh q1 report on bundle protocol cover and its
28:59
performance but in the last two weeks we have seen more than $7 million of cover
29:04
sold and um the products has been a huge success looking at the previous week we
29:11
also see uh Pendle on top on the top of the list so it's the previous week of
29:17
March and we had $8.2 Million worth of
29:22
cover sold in that uh in that week as well so overall we're like Brave
29:29
highlighted we're seeing increased cover sales uh week over week and the q1
29:35
report will provide a good overview with with the main highlights and what what
29:40
is up next for the mutual now I want to kick things off for
Open Forum
29:49
the open forum and receive any um questions from the community but before
29:56
I do that I want to share some details about how we're going to distribute the
30:02
poab um if you're listening to us please follow the Nexus Mutual do Twitter
30:08
account if you're not doing it already it's not this main account but um it's
30:13
the da account and uh you should be able to find it in the main account somewhere
30:20
next is mutual da and if you could send a DM to that account requesting a PO app
30:27
I will uh and we will reach out to DMS and let you know um what the path
30:35
forward is to claim the PO app so please do so it's a neat little
30:41
po app that we designed with um with some group of
30:46
turtles and I think it's a good memorabilia but yeah um let's kick the
30:52
open Forum uh let's get it started what are you doing these days in D5
30:58
and um also Brave do you have any other questions to The Listener Community
31:06
here yeah I think the only thing on my side is for the p app um if you DM the
31:11
Nexus Mutual Dow account um we'll send you a claim link for the poab if you'd like one so um I'm
31:19
just leaving a comment right now that tags the Nexus Mutual da account so you can find that in the comments um go
31:25
there and then send a DM to that accounts and we will distribute the poop
31:30
links that way um but yeah I would love to know what anybody here is doing in defi what they're interested in um and
31:37
if they have any questions about the mutual or anything that that we're doing on our
31:43
end if you want to come up on this stage just make a request and I'll bring you on up um in the meantime I just wanted
31:51
to highlight the uh the Nexus Mutual staking pools so for people that may
31:58
staking pools um you and myself both manage a staking pool within the mutual um you can create your own
32:06
staking pool and manage your nxm stake you can stake and delegate your nxm to an existing pool manager but with that
32:12
uptick and cover buys we're seeing some pretty sizable pool apy for some of the
32:18
different staking pools um the Nexus Mutual uh Foundation
32:24
pool which is a private pool that you can't delegate to is currently in the Le with the highest pool apy of
32:31
21.6% on the nxm in that pool um and then pool 22 uh which is my pool is at 20 uh about
32:39
59% apy um some other high apy on Hughes
32:45
personal pool and the EAS medium risk pool as well um we've seen some
32:51
increases in apis on the Sherlock pool as they've just recently bought um some more cover uh there so I think we'll
33:00
see higher apy in a lot of these pools as we see growth in cover over time so
33:06
if you're interested in creating and managing your own saking pool or saking and delegating be sure to check out the
33:12
stake um tab on the Nexus Mutual uh user interface so you can find
33:19
that there and look at the pools and see what each pool manager is underwriting an at what price um but I think it's
33:24
been pretty exciting to see some of these pool apy take off after kind of hovering in the 68% range for a while um
33:32
so as we sell more cover you can expect for those pool apy to kind of grow over time as
33:39
well but yeah if anybody has any requests um feel free otherwise if not
33:45
we can we can wrap things
33:51
up all right if you don't have any questions now but do so in the future you can find us on Discord
