this is a um deal that we've been um
0:02
discussing with the covery team for
0:04
probably about 9 months now so um it's
0:06
kind of come together in the in the last
0:08
month or so um working out all all the
0:10
details but um obviously it's a pretty
0:12
big proposal from from the mutuals
0:14
perspective at the moment we're writing
0:17
about 800,000 to a million of of kind of
0:20
you know um cover costs in a year so
0:23
like I guess I'm not trying not to use
0:24
the word premium but the equivalent um
0:27
for a discretionary Mutual so that's um
0:30
this deal would kind of significantly
0:31
increase that by 10x or even even more
0:34
um so it's quite a it's quite a material
0:36
deal that we've working on for for some
0:37
time and so it is Rel a bit complicated
0:42
but um I just kind of want to run
0:44
through the the high level with people
0:45
here because um we're planning to um put
0:47
it to the formal governance vote um
0:49
later this week there's a whole bunch of
0:51
details on the Forum there's this
0:54
essentially um The Proposal is
0:56
essentially giving the advisor board
0:58
power to kind of enter into these
0:59
Arrangements um on behalf of the mutual
1:01
with covery it's going to be a mixture
1:03
of technical onchain stuff um as well as
1:05
legal documents um that would need
1:07
signing um and they would be signed on
1:09
behalf of terapin International
1:11
Foundation which is the foundation that
1:13
holds the mutuals assets um and so
1:17
there's a combination of offchain stuff
1:18
and onchain stuff going on here um and
1:21
at a very high level there are there are
1:23
two main components to this one is an
1:25
investment um in DEC Discovery um and
1:28
the second is a retrocession so um I'll
1:31
get into the details of covery first um
1:34
they are a Cayman Islands based um
1:37
company they're a reinsurer um and they
1:39
cover a variety of normal like business
1:41
lines so like property um Auto um
1:44
liability the whole bunch of different
1:46
lines um and so they effectively
1:48
reinsure insurance companies um and they
1:51
take on um Big Blocks of business in in
1:54
one go so they have like about six or
1:56
seven deals that they've done um but
1:59
each deal there's like a bunch of a
2:01
portfolio of of underlying coverage from
2:03
different insurance companies um the
2:06
business is a lot more stable than the
2:09
stuff that we've written previously out
2:10
of the mutual because it's basically
2:12
it's already kind of Diversified like
2:14
it's got a lot of underlying risks under
2:16
underneath it and so they're taking out
2:17
a whole portfolio which has relatively
2:19
stable and predictable claims each year
2:21
obviously there's still variability but
2:23
relative to the business lines that the
2:25
mutual is running at the moment um which
2:27
are very yes or no does a payout
2:30
um the it's much more stable and
2:33
predictable um and I think in general
2:36
where um cover ER at or re um they are
2:41
the point where they want to deploy or
2:44
there's they've got a lot of business
2:45
opportunities to grow um but they need
2:47
some Capital to to grow and so the
2:49
investment um is a key component of this
2:53
um deal for them um it would allow them
2:55
to grow their premium volume
2:56
substantially so the currently from my
2:59
understanding um in the like 30 to 50
3:02
kind of million range in terms of
3:03
Premium volume um and they this an
3:06
additional Capital could get them quite
3:07
easily up to 150 or even even more um
3:11
and so this is that's that's quite
3:12
important from their perspective um and
3:15
I guess the other side is the Nexus
3:16
Mutual obviously we have underwriting
3:18
Capital we're ready to deploy and we
3:19
want to increase cover volume so this is
3:21
quite uh strategically very aligned at a
3:24
higher level and um part of the
3:27
challenge here is that they're are
3:28
traditional insurance regulated company
3:31
and Nexus Mutual isn't obviously onchain
3:33
Defi and how do we kind of bridge those
3:35
two worlds together um and this kind of
3:38
deal as a whole is a um is a is a way to
3:41
do that and that's essentially what
3:42
we're trying to do
3:44
here um yeah so to give you a bit of an
3:47
overview of the the structure so this
3:49
contains the two components on the top
3:53
of the diagram you can see the
3:54
investment component which is um pretty
3:56
pretty simply the an investment into um
3:59
cover1 which is the specific vehicle um
4:03
legal entity
4:05
and and that will um basically allow
4:08
covery to um to grow their um volumes
4:12
their premium volumes and so this is um
4:15
structured as um a participation note
4:18
it's kind of basically the investment
4:20
can get fully wiped if there's bad
4:22
claims experience so it is kind of
4:24
variable but there's also upside as well
4:27
so it it is variable but um the expected
4:30
returns are probably somewhere in the 18
4:32
to
4:33
20% um return on um stable coins um so I
4:39
mean it could be a bit higher than that
4:40
but like we've conservatively estimated
4:41
it at that level um so that's kind of
4:44
the 12 million investment then
4:46
additionally there's the retrocession on
4:48
the investment side um essentially we'd
4:51
be looking to sell um 12 million of e
4:54
for stable coins that's kind of the um I
4:57
guess one of the big aspects of this on
4:59
that point in particular I've seen
5:00
comments from several members that they
5:02
um would probably be willing to borrow
5:05
the against e to get the stable coins to
5:07
maintain the eth exposure um so I'm
5:09
going to be I'm talking to a bunch of
5:11
other members over the um Coming days
5:13
before putting this on chain to see if
5:15
that is a more palatable option rather
5:17
than selling the eth now withstanding
5:19
that um kind of went through the um the
5:21
kind of Roi expected Roi on the deal in
5:24
terms of the technical requirements um
5:27
this is essentially we have to create a
5:29
a token that represents the um offchain
5:32
investment and it was H in the capital
5:33
pool and that would need an oracle um so
5:36
there's a different set of trust
5:37
assumptions here but essentially we are
5:38
taking some money off chain out of the
5:40
capital Hall and that's something that
5:41
members would need to be um aware of and
5:44
and agree to um so that's kind of the
5:46
the two main aspects here um it's I mean
5:50
it's relatively simple but it's got a
5:52
quite High um Roi um the one of the
5:55
interesting Parts about this is that um
5:59
to me the interesting part from Nexus is
6:01
really the retrocession part of the deal
6:03
um but to access the retrocession part
6:05
of the deal we actually need to do the
6:06
investment as well they kind of come as
6:07
a package so moving on to the
6:11
retrocession um the idea here is that we
6:13
would take 15% of the underlying
6:16
business that cover rewrites in 2024 so
6:19
basically same terms on the entire book
6:21
um we just take 15% of it um capped at
6:25
15 million
6:27
premium and the expected margin on this
6:29
is a bit lower is is lower than our
6:31
usual stuff but um it's much more stable
6:34
um and so it's going to be about um
6:39
1.7 million of expected margin on um a
6:42
gross premium 15 the net premium which
6:44
is what we would actually get in Revenue
6:46
something like 11 or 12 from memory um
6:49
so it's probably the one the numbers to
6:52
reference are 11 or 12 um 1.7 on 11 or
6:55
12 gives you the margin um one of the
6:58
interesting aspects of this de deal is
6:59
the losses would be capped at 3 million
7:02
above net premium so we can never lose
7:03
more than 3 million above what um the um
7:07
the retrocession premiums would be um
7:11
the the the reason we can do this um and
7:15
well this requires approval by SEMA
7:17
which is the um Cayman monetary
7:19
Authority so the regulator and they they
7:22
require us to essentially post 3 million
7:25
of collateral in a trust account um
7:27
which is owned by Nexus but it's at the
7:30
call of covery um which would it's
7:32
basically that corresponds to the total
7:34
losses that we could incur on this deal
7:36
and what that means is if Nexus doesn't
7:38
pay out in line with the terms and
7:40
conditions then they can go after the
7:41
collateral so it's kind of removes the
7:44
regulatory risk of dealing with the um
7:46
funny defi thing over here that they're
7:48
not quite sure about um and so this is
7:50
kind of the um it's obviously not ideal
7:53
from our perspective it takes more money
7:54
off chain um but it's kind of what we
7:56
would need to do to be able to bridge
7:58
into more I guess traditional um
8:01
Insurance space and so I think this is
8:03
an very interesting aspect of things
8:06
because it um could serve as a blueprint
8:09
for future deals about being able to
8:12
access traditional um Insurance markets
8:14
in in it kind of like the way that maker
8:17
kind of does their real world assets and
8:19
stuff like that it's obviously different
8:21
legal structures and all the rest of it
8:22
but um I guess at a higher level it's
8:24
kind of the the equivalent in the in the
8:27
insurance World there is one other
8:28
aspect that that members should be aware
8:30
of here and that's a we're going to
8:33
operate this on a funds withheld basis
8:35
and what that means is the the covery
8:38
wouldn't pay cash for the premiums up
8:40
front um they would pay um the net
8:43
result of premiums um less claims at a
8:47
later stage once the
8:49
um once the deal has like the experience
8:52
of the deal and the claims are come
8:53
through and we confident that what
8:54
they're going to be um and that's quite
8:56
important it's it's NE it's necessary
8:58
for govern a re because they operate on
9:00
funds with held basis with the
9:02
underlying insurance company so um if we
9:04
didn't as well there'd be a cash flow
9:06
issue that they wouldn't be able to pay
9:07
the the premiums um and also it deals
9:10
with it helps deal with the credit risk
9:11
so there are two um non-standard things
9:14
a part of as part of this deal one is
9:16
the funds withheld and the other is the
9:18
collateral um so those are the two
9:20
things that um members need to be aware
9:22
of the funds withheld is an interesting
9:24
point because developing this um payment
9:27
token um could be used for other deals
9:30
as well so um it's not just um a oneoff
9:33
thing for covery it could be more widely
9:36
useful for other for other deals in the
9:39
future um yeah so I guess where we're at
9:41
in terms of the um the process we're
9:43
just having discussions at the moment um
9:45
I think I've I've received quite
9:47
positive feedback um both on the Forum
9:49
but also um not not on the Forum just
9:53
directly and with I guess one of the
9:55
bigger outstanding points being um do
9:58
you sell the e e into Stables or do we
10:00
um essentially borrow um to get to get
10:03
them and so I'm just going to um do a
10:06
few discussions extra discussions on the
10:08
next couple of days and the the final
10:10
proposal that goes on chain may be
10:12
either swapping into stable coins or
10:15
borrowing um so that's basically the
10:17
only change that um would be proposed um
10:20
so far out of as a result of the
10:23
discussion so far um yeah so that was a
10:26
very quick I guess wiiz through of of
10:29
covery um but I'm happy to take any
10:32
questions on that cool I think that is
10:35
no questions but yeah please follow up
10:37
on on the Forum or in Discord or
10:39
wherever um you'd like and happy to
10:41
enter them there
