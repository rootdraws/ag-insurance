the Dow Community team posted the Q3 and
0:05
Q4 team road map which provides an
0:08
overview of what the foundation and DOW
0:10
teams are prioritizing over the next six
0:11
months we've recap our core objectives
0:14
progress to date imp planned initiatives
0:16
the down found Foundation teams are
0:18
really committed to transparency and so
0:20
we share our latest goals and efforts on
0:23
the Forum on a six-month basis looking
0:26
at our core objectives they remain
0:28
unchanged we're still laser focused on
0:29
growth
0:30
looking at um growing cover sales
0:32
through new product launches developing
0:35
new products that can help us scale
0:36
cover growth as well and generate more
0:38
premiums for the capital pool the R&D
0:42
team is working on the last phase of the
0:44
tokenomics project which is our second
0:46
priority um this project is focused on
0:48
how the MCR Works in low Capital
0:50
situations they'll be working on that in
0:53
Q3 and Q4 and we're working on a wider
0:56
research project for governance which
0:57
the R&D and Community teams are leading
0:59
the first phase of after that the
1:01
engineering team will take over and
1:03
research the application implementation
1:05
requirements um that third priority is
1:08
Progressive decentralization to get more
1:11
people involved within the mutual and
1:13
the governance decisions that dictate
1:15
the future direction that the mutual
1:17
goes in so we're working on a system
1:19
that's more inclusive and one that is
1:21
easier for people to participate in and
1:24
stay more involved in within the mutual
1:27
so those core objectives remain
1:28
unchanged you can find those on the
1:30
forum for the teams they've all provided
1:32
updates as well and I'll share some
1:34
highlights from each of the major teams
1:38
on the Foundation Engineering team I
1:39
think H shared some of these but they're
1:41
going to be focusing on the user
1:43
interface and user experience
1:45
improvements so like you said we've
1:47
already seen a few go live the
1:49
membership flow I Believe has just gone
1:52
live or will be going live very soon so
1:54
when people sign up there'll be a
1:55
different flow the goal is to reduce
1:57
friction and make it as easy as possible
2:00
for people to onboard to the mutual um
2:03
there are going to be some other
2:04
improvements like the main dashboard
2:06
that you see in the Nexus Mutual UI
2:08
right now it's just says uh membership
2:11
but we're going to kind of reconfigure
2:13
that UI so it's easier for you to keep
2:15
track of all of your deposits within the
2:17
protocol and stay up to date on
2:19
everything you're doing within the
2:20
mutual and then learning about different
2:21
ways you can get involved as well so
2:24
kind of making that dashboard an
2:25
allinone place for you to look at your
2:27
participation within the mutual uh the
2:30
engineering team is going to be working
2:32
with uh ultim Design Studio which we've
2:34
been working with on the previous uh
2:36
improvements to the UI but the next
2:38
flows that we're going to be working on
2:40
are the staking and claims UI um we're
2:42
going to be overhauling both of those so
2:45
look out for updates on those later in
2:47
Q3 or Q4 and then um any remaining user
2:50
flows are going to be tackled after we
2:52
get through the sing and claims uh flows
2:55
as well um the engineering team is also
2:58
going to be working on limit orders I
2:59
think you um cover this but just having
3:02
a better function for uh matching supply
3:05
and demand so if people want to request
3:06
capacity they don't have to do it to the
3:08
contact form they can do it right on
3:09
Shain and the staking pool operators or
3:12
staking pool managers can see that and
3:14
decide which limit orders they want to
3:16
fill to make it more of a seamless
3:18
process for people that want to buy
3:20
cover or people that want to supply
3:22
capacity where it's not currently
3:23
available and then the engineering team
3:25
is going to be launching the cover edit
3:27
feature we've talked about this there
3:28
have been some delays
3:30
but um this should be coming we've got
3:32
an engineer that's dedicated to this and
3:35
um this should facilitate easier
3:36
renewals for people without the need to
3:38
Min A New nft U this will be really
3:40
helpful for our distribution Partners uh
3:43
there are more updates for from the
3:45
engineering team but just want to give
3:46
you a highlight on the top three
3:49
priorities for these teams for the
3:51
foundation business and development team
3:54
they are going to be focusing on driving
3:55
point of sale Integrations we've already
3:57
seen Integrations in the EFI liquid
4:00
vaults um and eies UI which has been
4:02
great but they're working on developing
4:04
some standardized requirements for the
4:06
purchasing experience in other uis
4:09
they're talking to different protocols
4:10
to get more point of sale Integrations
4:12
to help us build out our
4:13
distribution um Network within defi so
4:17
just to make it as easy as POS possible
4:18
for people to buy cover um they're going
4:21
to be working on more white glove and
4:22
bespoke solutions for uh different
4:26
audiences that are coming to the mutual
4:27
a lot of higher Network individuals or
4:29
funds working on more solutions for them
4:32
to make it easier for them to purchase
4:34
cover to the mutual and get faster
4:36
service so that they keep coming back
4:38
and keep buying coverage and then the BD
4:40
team is also going to be managing the
4:41
grants and accelerator program um Dopey
4:44
is kind of leading the efforts here but
4:46
the efforts launch on like a a big
4:48
public launch the program conducting
4:50
Outreach which is already something
4:51
they've been working on and then aing to
4:54
onboard one Syndicate and fund six
4:55
grants that will contribute to the Nexus
4:58
meal ecosystem
5:00
on the product and risk side um we're
5:01
going to be entering R&D on a new bundle
5:04
type product that's designed to provide
5:06
cover across multiple protocols I
5:08
believe he talked a little bit about
5:09
this as well but given the success we've
5:11
seen with bundle protocol cover we've
5:12
been playing around with an idea for a
5:15
different product that has kind of
5:16
all-in-one coverage for certain nonchain
5:19
ecosystems so um I'll talk about this uh
5:22
after I go through this highlight as
5:23
well because we currently have a survey
5:25
that I would really love for people to
5:26
fill out and provide some feedback on
5:29
but the goal is to develop and finalize
5:31
this product and then launch this
5:32
sometime in Q3 or Q4 we're also going to
5:35
be working to support new and existing
5:37
syndicates on new product development um
5:39
you know some of the examples we've seen
5:41
are the retail Mutual um Sherlock some
5:45
people that are building on top of us
5:46
that want uh to launch new cover
5:49
products and then distribute those cover
5:50
products we're going to be working with
5:52
more syndicates and more syndicates that
5:53
are coming on chain as well um to build
5:55
out products and kind of expand
5:57
distribution and of course increase
5:58
sales and then I'm going to be heading
6:00
up a bridge research uh project for
6:03
bridge risk we've seen a lot of requests
6:05
for bridge cover um but it isn't a
6:07
product that we currently offer I'm
6:09
going to do a deep dive on bridge
6:11
infrastructure and risk create a risk
6:13
framework for this and then we can
6:15
create a pricing model for this risk and
6:16
work on some cover wording so we can
6:18
launch a bridge cover product in the
6:21
future on the R&D side they're going to
6:23
be focused on the product and protocol
6:25
so they're going to provide input on
6:26
pricing for new products using their
6:29
actual
6:30
Actuarial experience they're going to
6:32
support on design and sessing out edge
6:35
cases for new technical projects and
6:38
then they're going to help on the
6:39
business side design and uh on
6:42
engineering heavy projects where they
6:44
can provide some help uh on lift for the
6:46
engineering team on the D analytics side
6:49
we've got toas who's a really great Dune
6:51
wizard um he's going to help us create
6:53
some new dashboards we've already
6:54
launched uh a couple or overhauled some
6:56
that we have you can see those in the
6:58
Nexus Mutual June dashboard um overview
7:02
you can see all the dashboards we have
7:04
uh the the BD dashboard that he recently
7:06
launched is really great so he's going
7:07
to maintain those dashboards keep them
7:09
up to date uh if there's any protocol
7:11
changes and then build out some more to
7:13
support some people in our ecosystem and
7:14
of course the R&D team is going to work
7:16
on that MCR calculation project that I
7:18
talked about on the Dow Community team
7:21
side uh Dow Community team is going to
7:23
be focused on creating new guides for
7:24
members and Stak pool managers so as the
7:27
UI is changed um we want to make sure
7:29
that we're providing updated resource
7:32
updated resources like video guides and
7:34
written resources to assist people that
7:36
are buying cover or launching or
7:38
managing staking pools people that need
7:41
to file claims pretty much going through
7:42
all of the flows and making some guides
7:44
so it's as easy as possible to
7:46
understand how the mutual works and how
7:47
to contribute in these core functions um
7:49
the Dow Community team is also going to
7:51
work on designing an onboarding program
7:53
we know that it can be kind of
7:54
intimidating to on board to the mutual
7:57
and kind of get accustomed to all of the
7:58
different flows and all of the different
8:00
roles that you can perform within the
8:01
mutual so the community team is going to
8:03
design an onboarding program so new
8:06
people can come into Discord or they can
8:08
sign up through other means and they can
8:09
basically jump on a call on a bi-weekly
8:12
Cadence something along those lines and
8:15
kind of cover the basics about the
8:16
mutual and ask questions so we can
8:18
support more people getting involved in
8:19
the ecosystem and then the D Community
8:22
team is going to continue the covering T
8:23
interview series on Twitter faces so uh
8:27
look for more updates about that of
8:29
course there's a lot more included in
8:31
the latest road map um I'm sure nobody
8:33
wants to hear me run through the entire
8:34
thing but you can find that road map on
8:36
the Nexus Mutual governance Forum or you
8:38
can wait for a special issue of the
8:40
Hedge that's going to recap a lot of
8:43
this road map as well um in the Hedge if
8:45
you're not aware is the mutuals
8:47
community newsletter that goes out on a
8:49
monthly basis this special issue is
8:51
going to be um in between our our two
8:53
monthly issues that'll be coming out the
8:55
next couple of weeks so look for
8:56
announcements from the Nexus Mutual
8:59
Twitter
9:00
um Nexus Mutual Discord and Nexus Mutual
9:02
telegram channels as well as on LinkedIn
