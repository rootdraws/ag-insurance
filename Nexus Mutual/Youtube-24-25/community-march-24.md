Cadence this week we have Brave on the call with us today he was unable to join
Agenda
0:40
as he is joining a conference in London and we're going to be going over the
0:46
state of defi uh Brave has published another great report well actually it's
0:52
the third issue of the state of defi report and it's immensely
0:57
helpful um so he's going to give us an overview of the state of defi in yields
1:03
and risk um Hil if you haven't checked it out I was just mentioning Braves
1:08
amazing state of defi report uh the third issue is now live and then we're
1:14
going to Segway into a new cover product announcement I think this has been um
1:21
very well received by some members already and brave will walk us through
1:26
the details of I of our new uh cover and then he will highlight some of the
1:33
news from our partner open cover on open cover you can buy cover on layer twos of
1:40
your choice which I find very convenient and then um we'll introduce you to a new
1:47
series um hosted by the da Community team will be interviewing important
1:52
security Partners from defi starting from tomorrow with um grid plus uh
1:58
Justin will be joining in a conversation with brave we'll briefly touch on that
2:03
and then um we'll have the chance to answer any open questions without further Ado I want to
2:10
ask Brave uh how is the state of defi in risks and yields this week grave take it
BraveNewDeFi's State of DeFi Yields Report
2:17
away yeah for the last week um in defi
2:23
yields yields are still pretty high I had talked in my report about just the you know the pullback on eth we've seen
2:29
that move back a little bit you know we got as high as a little over 4,000 but now we're kind of bouncing between
2:36
somewhere between 3200 and 3700 and I think that'll kind of be the case for the next um you know the next several
2:44
weeks if not the next couple months but um yeah that's that's my personal take we'll we'll see uh we'll see what the
2:50
the prices bear out um but because there's been more price action we've
2:55
seen more activity uh on chain and some of the things that we've seen are an
3:01
increase in the base rate for stable coins which in my report I highlighted is somewhere between 18 to 25% now which
3:08
is up I think um from when I started about uh like 1.5 times so we're seeing
3:15
a lot of the stable coin uh rates in defi increase and a lot of it starts at
3:20
lending protocols right so we've seen a and compound have adjusted their interest rate curve models so that
3:27
they're charging a higher price when um blending markets are at a high rate of utilization roughly about the 90% point
3:35
so we've seen across a across their markets on l2s and on mnet and the same
3:41
thing for compound the utilization is at or above 90% very frequently there's a
3:47
large appetite for leverage in the current market um and as a response to
3:52
that significant demand in those you know High double digigit uh apy for
3:58
lenders we saw that maker Dow decided to push through a pretty aggressive change
4:03
which increased the stability fees which are their interest rates on their maker
4:09
Dow CDP vaults and they pushed those up somewhere between 15 and 20% Which is
4:15
unprecedented for them and they also boosted up the die savings rate to 15%
4:20
which is the highest that it's ever been so that rate has also kind of bolstered
4:26
higher stable coin um yields across Defi and so a lot of this uh a lot of the the
4:33
rates you're going to see for stable coins start at the leting protocol level because that is one of the fundamental
4:39
uh money Legos that people build on top of with other protocols so that is
4:45
definitely something that you can see um another lending Market that urine is built on top of with their juice vaults
4:52
is AA and urine has this uh really great interface it's called urine juice Vault
4:58
you can find it right in the urine UI or at juice. apppp um and in the the juice
5:03
faults what they do is they deposit uh Dy eth or usdc into the asna markets and
5:10
they're able to juice the yield so to speak with extra token rewards so for the DI Vault and the usdc vaults um you
5:18
know again we're talking double digit yields from what I checked this morning the D vault is around 35% variable apy
5:25
and the usdc vault is a little over 24% variable API um I cover that in my
5:30
report as well but that one's been very interesting to watch uh urn has used AA as a you know as a growth money Lego and
5:38
that's another lending Market out there there have been some interesting ones too some um stable coin strategies are a
5:44
bit more complex the D hedge Perpetual delta neutral vault which um you know
5:50
goes off of rates underneath in synthetics they've been running this delta neutral yield strategy which has
5:56
been something that's been very popular people have been talking a lot about that that kind of strategy with what uh
6:01
Athena is doing as well but the D hedge Perpetual delta neutral uh Vault has
6:08
been earning somewhere around 63% variable apy based on the last 30 days
6:14
of performance so there are some pretty high yield opportunities out there uh as well we've seen the same on pendall so
6:20
for pendall for eth or stable coin yields we've seen things pretty high the susd e um pendall uh market for you know
6:31
selling your yield if you're an ssde holder has been very high that's been about 90% fixed apy for people that are
6:39
willing to sell their shards on usde on mainnet it's like 196% fixed API and
6:46
then people who want to provide liquidity for a usdc so a usdc um on
6:51
pendall on arbitrum you know that's going for like a 25% variable apy so again seeing really high apis and then
6:58
for things that are bit more complex and I note this in my report you know the the riskier things um hyper liquid on
7:05
arbitrum is one it's similar to you know it's a Perpetual exchange so it's similar to to GMX and their glp but they
7:13
have a hyper liquidity provider vaults um that's offering about 133% uh variable APR um as a depositor
7:21
in that fault you deposit usdc and you are a counterparty to Traders within hyper liquidity so it definitely comes
7:28
with risks but again that's just kind of showing the range of yields we're sitting on stable coins um as far as the
7:35
eth base rate this is always going to be tied back to you know eth staking yields so it's still between 2.5 to 5% there
7:43
have been some other um e staking protocols that have emerged here in the last couple months that are growing tvl
7:51
and growing deposits they offer a little bit of a higher um apy I've noted those
7:57
in my report as well but uh but yeah that's what the eth base rate is always going to be is right around that staking
8:02
yield um we've seen lending markets trying to increase demand uh a launched their Merit program on mainnet and with
8:09
that they are offering incentives for people that borrow we on mainnet and also people that borrow go on mainnet so
8:16
that should theoretically if it works that should bring up the varful ABY for
8:21
we lenders on a mainnet right now it's at 1.63% so it's still under that base
8:27
rate um there was a lot of we Demand on the compound V3 markets on base um right
8:33
now it's sitting at 4.37% but earlier um last week it was around 63% so I'm not
8:40
exactly sure what uh what the demand for eth was on base why it was so high but um yeah it was definitely up there last
8:47
week uh we recently launched uh frax protocol cover as well and so the frax
8:53
markets for we have been high consistently um the rates on WE within
8:59
the the fra Market is around 33% Perle apy um so yeah again we have cover on
9:04
that all the things I've talked about we have uh cover for with a Nexus Mutual um and then for pendall um for the liquid
9:11
reaking tokens you know still high fixed apy for the Renzo eth if you want to
9:17
sell your yield um and your points for kelp eth and for ethery E I know ethery
9:25
just launched their token um but there's still those markets where people are selling the ethery tokens and the points
9:33
that people are acre um for igen layer as well so those
9:38
markets are still pretty hot on both mainnet and on um on arbitrum you can
9:45
check those out um again more information on that my report we've listed PX eth from uh daero which is uh
9:53
developed by the redactive cartel folks and PX eth is a tokenized version of eth
9:58
it's an eth derivative there are Market strategies for um you know correlated
10:03
assets other liquid staking assets as well you can find that in the report and then we also um listed FX protocol which
10:11
is a protocol where you can take e deposit it and then you can have on the one side um like a vol a lower
10:19
volatility stable coin and then on the other side like a higher volatility exposure to eth with leverage um that's
10:26
been very popular uh for the FX protocol they have their stability pools which are similar if you're familiar with like
10:32
liquidy stability pools you can deposit certain Assets in there and earn double digit yields again that comes with risk
10:38
if there's ever an extreme Market event where they need to basically convert your state eth into assets to maintain
10:45
stability within the protocol that's something that is in there but again these are all things you know that are popping up so even for eth you can still
10:52
earn double digit yields so it's been kind of crazy to see the market pop off and for yields to be so high um there's
10:59
still a lot of high yield opportunities out there for people of all experience levels whether you know you just want to
11:04
deposit some stable coins into a markets or you know you want to go uh you know a more risky strategy that has more smart
11:12
contract and more Market risk some of those things we have a lot of different protocols listed on Nexus so you can
11:17
definitely protect against smart contract and some economic risks on Ling markets as well um you can buy cover for
11:23
that and I don't think that the yields we're currently seeing are going to go down anytime soon you know eth might
11:30
Bounce Around in price but I think that these high yields are here to stay especially as long as the lending
11:35
markets are kind of driving them with some of their uh interest rate um settings as well so uh yeah it's been
11:41
very interesting I've enjoyed writing these state of defi yields reports it's also a way to highlight some of the um
11:47
you know covered yield opportunities that are out there but uh but yeah uh issue three went out last Friday uh
11:54
Issue four will be out this week I publish these reports on every Friday you can can you know see these published
12:00
on my Twitter and forecaster accounts but again my goal here is just to kind of give people an overview of where the
12:06
D5 markets are at what yield opportunities are out there and where you can buy cover to protect yourself against smart contract and different
12:14
technical risks and defi since that's still a pretty prominent issue I mean there's been billions lost here in the
12:20
last several years to defi hacks and that's one of the things that we're working to protect people against more
12:26
within defi um I really love to see 2024 be a safer year for Define to protect
12:32
more people against smart contract and economic risk and defi um before I move on does anybody
12:38
have any questions about uh this overview if not I can just drop uh an
12:45
update in the thread below after the call so people can reference back to that if they'd like to check that out um
12:52
but I will move on and talk a little bit about our new cover product which is bundle protocol cover I'm going to make
12:58
this announcement right after we oh okay Billy I'll invite
13:03
you up so you can talk
13:08
hey hey Brave how's it going it's going okay how are
13:14
you I'm doing well well I wanted to ask a quick question so you know my
13:20
understanding from like previous Cycles is you know Insurance um broadly was
13:26
taken out by users across D5 protocols because of you know higher apys that
13:33
they could earn on farming um and you know throughout the bear it was less you know there was less
13:39
cover being sought by individuals because you know the the cost of the insurance relative to the yield
13:45
opportunities weren't quite there but wanted to you know see if that wave has
13:50
kind of shifted with the higher yields that you were you've been referencing um across the various lending opportunities
13:57
and just yield opportunities General generally in the D5 space yes yeah that's exactly right so
14:04
you know during the bare Market yields and defi were relatively low there might have been some like higher yield
14:11
opportunities but they were kind of few and far between now that we've seen things really take off we are seeing
14:16
growth in cover sales um so we're starting slowly that's still something that the team is heavily focused on is
14:22
selling more cover growing cover sales right now we're at about 44 45 million in active cover um that's something
14:29
again that we're working to grow over time we're working with open cover I'll provide an update on what open cover is
14:34
doing but they are helping us sell cover on l2s they're built on top of the Nexus Mutual protocol and they're making cover
14:40
a lot more accessible to people um on l2s where the transaction fees are considerably lower than they are on
14:45
mainnet and yeah we have a lot of things in the pipeline as well on kind of different ways that we're making it
14:51
easier for people to buy cover and protect themselves um and you know
14:56
different uh initiatives that will be announced in the near future about ways that we're expanding distribution and
15:03
kind of getting the word out there about Nexus mutual and making it a lot easier to protect yourself against risk so uh
15:10
there will be a lot more updates on this but we are seeing a lot more inbound about people looking to buy cover for
15:16
people looking to buy cover in size um so a lot of that is just getting some of these newer protocol cover listings up
New: Bundled Protocol Cover
15:23
um I think that with bundle protocol cover which I'll go over here this will be a a really Big Ben benefit for people
15:29
as well because for the longest time people have asked if I buy cover for baby does it cover against the
15:35
underlying um smart contract risk which for normal protocol cover it doesn't um
15:42
but flowing into this announcement uh this new protocol cover offering which is Bott of protocol cover um allows you
15:49
to buy one cover nft to protect against smart contract risk down the full stack
15:55
so if you're depositing into urine vaults for example which I touched on um
16:01
that one urine Juiced vaults bundle protocol cover is going to protect you against smart contract and economic risk
16:07
within year and AA smart contracts if you're depositing into a beefy Vault
16:12
that has balancer V2 and or a finance exposure underneath that's going to cover against all three of those um you
16:19
know all three of those protocols in the smart contract risk there um so we have six initial listings for this which is
16:27
for p juice faults beefy and curve beefy and compound V3 beefy balancer V2 and
16:34
Aura is one bundle um quent and synthetics we've had a lot of people request this in the past as well and
16:40
then for one of the Pendle strategies igen lier ethery and Pendle bundled protocol cover um what I will say is
16:47
that before we announced this just last week somebody had asked about the aan layer ethery Pendle bundle cover and I
16:53
said you know we actually just listed this it's in the UI we haven't made an announcement yet and the first person that I had mentioned this to went out
17:00
and bought $300,000 worth of cover so um I think that this is going to be a really popular product and I'm excited
17:06
to work on the marketing side of this kind of create some awareness work on some co-marketing with some of these
17:11
protocols and get the word out about Bund of protocol cover but again that announcement is going to go out after
17:17
the community call to day um and you'll see more announcements about these individual listings as we push those out
17:23
this week so I'm excited about this I know personally speaking um you know the
17:29
gas costs can be kind of high if you're buying let's say three different protocol covers but just being able to buy one cover to protect against you
17:36
know the underlying smart contract risk is going to be great I'm definitely going to be using it um and like I said
17:42
we started with these six initial listings based on past request and historic cover sales and over time we'll add more
17:50
bundle protocol cover listings as well um if there are other bundle protocol cover listings that you'd like to see
17:56
you can join us on Discord lot of snow or you can drop a comment underneath the Twitter space is SK thread and I can
18:02
definitely check those out when we have our next product meeting which we have every Wednesday where we review listings
18:07
um and talk about new products as well so um I'm very excited to protect more
18:14
people in defi against smart contract and economic risks and again make 2024 a
18:19
safer safer year for people to participate in Defi and hopefully as we onboard more people through some of
18:25
these l2s those people can buy cover and protect themselves while earning in defi
18:31
um I'm happy to take any questions about this yeah no that's a really interesting product I think um the protocol that I
18:37
work with we're going to be launching you know Vault Partnerships um with some Vault developers you know so like you
18:44
know urine for example an enzyme and so that would be really interesting to have
18:50
you know multiple layers for depositors in those vaults um so no I'll follow up with you about that that's really cool
18:57
yeah absolutely um and it can be protocols we already have listed or ones that we don't have listed yet uh Billy
19:03
so feel free to follow up and and let me know so we're happy to add new listings and everything so yeah just reach out
19:10
and uh let me know what Vault you're looking for awesome man all right well thanks for the great call I have to jump
19:16
but uh enjoy the rest of your day all right thanks for joining
19:22
us all right any other questions on bundle protocol cover before I move on to talk about some open cover updates
OpenCover News
19:35
okay if not I will move on and talk a little bit about open cover so the open cover team has been working on adding
19:41
more protocol cover listings to their platform um their goal is to have all the protocols that we have listed all
19:47
available on opr cover so you can buy um protocol cover from Nexus Mutual on l2s
19:52
like Bas optimism and arbitrum um for those of you who aren't familiar with open cover they are a cover distributor
19:58
built on top of the NEX Spiritual Protocol open cover is helping to expand access to protocol cover on l2s where
20:04
the gas fees are considerably lower so we can protect everyone against risk regardless of the amount of funds that
20:09
they are earning in uh earning with in defi uh users don't need to kyc to use
20:14
open cover which is uh one point of friction that uh some people often bring
20:20
up so you know you don't have to kyc you can just chose open cover you can buy cover on an L2 and this should help us
20:28
reach more defi users the open cover team recently added Pendle and dedge to their platform and they'll be announcing
20:34
another listing this week on Wednesday as well um but yeah they've helped considerably they've sold uh I think
20:41
about 1.5 million in cover since they launched and so far in March open cover has sold uh over 600k worth of cover so
20:50
I'm definitely excited to see more cover sales coming in through open cover and um you know expanding protection to
20:56
cover holders of all sizes not just whales but um everyone in between as
21:01
well so yeah keep an eye out on open cover you can follow them on Twitter or you can kind of check our account for
21:08
updates as well because we often share updates about open cover I'll move on and talk about some
Team Updates
21:15
updates from the foundation so we've shared a few Updates this week um one of
21:20
these is about the FTX reimbursement so in 2023 the mutual paid out claims for
21:26
uh FTX Hol withdrawals and as part of the custody cover wording if people
21:31
receive reimbursement for um a failed custodian they you know have to assign
21:37
their bankruptcy claims over to the mutual and so the foundation's uh Chief legal officer has been working very hard
21:45
for the Mandate set out in nmpi 205 to recover um you know those reimbursements
21:51
and bring those back into the capital pool so we've made progress on this there's been 1.68 million in USD
21:57
reimbursed the mutual to date that is held in a multi- that The Advisory board
22:03
controls um because usdc is not a whitelisted asset in the capital pool
22:09
yet hasn't sent been sent directly to the capital pool but uh These funds will likely be used in the uh cover R deal
22:17
which we highlighted previously in a previous nmip that members approved in
22:23
December but um this will be reflected in the capital pool balance once the
22:29
covery strategy is executed uh we're expecting that more uh recoveries are going to come as the bankruptcy claims
22:35
are sold uh and the mutual expects to recover at least 2.48 million from these
22:41
FTX claims uh if not more so that full announcement is on the Forum uh on the
22:47
FTX reimbursement so you can check that out for more info there the team is still focused on shipping new cover
22:53
products and growing cover sales bundle protocol cover is the First new product we have some more covered products to
23:00
announce in the near future here um in April and May we'll have some things to announce as well as uh we'll be able to
23:06
provide some updates on the cover Redal um Pew on behalf of the foundation
23:12
proposed nmip 213 which went up for a vote last week
23:17
and members voted to approve this uh the votes here was about updating the um the
23:24
speed at which the price changes when people are buying cover for a particular
23:30
product so right now if a cover product is listed it'll start at an initial price and then it decays down to a
23:35
minimum price if a bunch of people Pile in and buy protocol cover for say pendall the D Dynamic pricing within the
23:42
mutual is going to move that price up that spreads coverb across the different staking pools and it also makes sure
23:49
that we're not um underwriting risk at too low a cost if demand for specific
23:54
risk is high uh the previous price change speed was
24:00
.5% which is relatively low so it took a long time for these cover products to
24:05
come back down in price to a level where cover buyers wanted to actually buy cover for protocol cover or any of the
24:12
other cover products that we offer and because of this uh there was probably some times where we were missing out on
24:18
certain cover sales so this has been updated to 2% per day which should bring down um cover pricing to a level that
24:27
people are willing to pay um this will bring down the the pricing much quicker than we've seen in the past so this
24:33
should be a big Improvement now that members have approved this um you can see the details on that on the Forum as
24:38
well and you can look at that vote outcome in the Nexus Mutual UI and I wanted to share that the engineering
24:44
team is finishing up testing on an update to the cover by UI uh this should improve the user experience and make it
24:50
easier to buy cover in the UI um there are also going to be some uh you know
24:55
notification settings in the UI that you can set up if you want a reminder about when to renew your cover um a reminder
25:03
about you know renewing your stake as an nxm Staker um we'll have different
25:08
notification services in there if you're waiting for capacity for a certain product you'll be able to set up a notification so that you're alerted when
25:15
capacity is open um on a given cover product so there's a lot of work being
25:21
done on the engineering team uh to get that UI update ready to ship um we'll
25:27
share more announcements and of course we'll make an announcement on the blog and across our socials when that new UI
25:32
is live um those are the updates I have for the foundation side uh I'm sure if
25:38
there's anything I'm missing I can have Hugh post an update in Discord uh when he gets back but he is currently at the
25:44
digital assets Summit in London um but yeah just an update that the foundation and DOW teams are still working hard
25:50
behind the scenes to sell more cover and deliver on the updated road map on the
25:55
Forum um and then I will transition over to an update about the interview series
26:02
um here uh s if you want to give an introduction to this or I can give an intro to the
Covering DeFi Interview Series
26:08
series of course thanks Brave um yeah we want to take a little time to introduce
26:14
our covering defi interview series which we will launch tomorrow with Justin from
26:20
grid plus Our intention behind organizing these interview series is to
26:26
have a space where community members um people interested in defi or just anyone
26:32
interested in Security in Defi and can come in and listen and we'll be interviewing upand cominging protocols
26:39
and um established players like grid Plus at first but we want to open the space up um to include users experiences
26:47
in defi um about staying safe in defi so
26:52
um I'm quite excited about this series um tomorrow we'll have Brave talk with
27:00
Justin from grid plus and there's going to be a little surprise um just the he things up
27:06
will'll be giving away one lettuce uh lettuce one um cold wallet to one of the listeners
27:14
and I think it's going to be quite exciting and interesting I'm looking forward to the talk tomorrow um Brave I
27:20
also want to ask you what we are um trying to establish with covering Defi
27:26
and what your thoughts are for the upcoming talk yeah I think for the covering defi
27:33
interview series that we're going to run um one of the main benefits is just talking with other defi Builders people
27:39
working in the security space and people using defi just to you know hear what
27:44
people's concerns are talk to the people that are building Security Solutions in defi um a lot of it will be focused on
27:51
risks that we cover and you know areas where we have expertise but also I want to talk with people who are working in
27:57
areas like um you know the grid plus folks talking about Harbor wallet security and some of these risks that we
28:04
don't cover but are still important building blocks about staying safe in defi so um yeah we'll talk with Justin
28:10
tomorrow about grid plus their latus one Hardware wallets and the work that
28:15
they're doing to help people stay safe against a lot of these very common risks that we're seeing in defi like blind
28:22
signing attacks um you know people accidentally signing malicious transaction requests
28:28
all of these things you know the latus one has been a great solution I personally use it myself so I'm looking
28:34
forward to talking to them about some of the updates on the gri plus side talking about ways to avoid um you know some of
28:40
these some of these scams and some of these different attack vectors in defi um you know and and just talking about
28:46
how to safely cust the you know uh crypto assets on chain if you're managing your own finances um we're also
28:54
going to be talking with some other builders um we have another one that's going to be lined up here um in April
29:00
we're going to talk about the folks that are building vaults FYI and I think broadly speaking it's
29:05
just an opportunity for us to talk with other builders and other Security Experts in the space and then kind of
29:10
educate people on you know what some of the latest updates are on the security side talk to people who are underwriting
29:17
risk within the mutual talk about people within our ecosystem and people broadly across the defi space so I think it
29:23
should be interesting and engaging and it's just a good opportunity to you know in listen to an interview and get
29:30
updated on you know a new def protocol or you know people that are working on innovative solutions to make it safer to
29:37
transact and interact within defi agreed and there's no end to
29:43
learning more about staying safe in defi I guess that's a never-ending journey
29:48
and I'm looking forward to beginning that Journey with our community members thanks
29:55
bra now I want to briefly Rec AP the last week together um with you guys um
Last Week in Numbers
30:02
we have the analysis up on the Forum where we look at how much the Mutual has
30:08
sold in cover and what fees we have earned it's quite interesting to me because it shows me what more
30:16
responsible Legion or more responsible um defi users are doing in Defi and last
30:23
week we sold about $3.8 Million worth of cover and earned more than
30:31
$32,000 in fees and um like Brave said earlier on
30:37
one of the bigger cover buys were for bundled cover for Igan layer ether FY
30:44
and Pendle I'm personally also looking forward to purchasing more bundle covers
30:49
because it's um Less in gas whs and you won't have to
30:54
purchase three different covers I think it's very practical and I think we're going to see more
31:00
cover buys um throughout March in bondle cover looking at the entire month of
31:08
March we have sold about $10 million worth of cover uh so it's definitely
31:15
heightened activity still going on like in February um we had quite a lot of uh
31:22
cover sold uh week over week and um if
31:27
you want to look learn more about our recent numbers recent sales please check
31:33
out the weekly analysis section on the Nexus Mutual
Open Forum
31:40
Forum now I want to open the space up for any member questions or anything
31:48
that you want to raise um right now I know Brave sometimes has really
31:53
interesting insights uh at the start of the call I wonder if any of the listeners would like to chip in with
31:59
their thoughts and some of the market movements in defi or Brave if you have
32:05
any questions to us yeah I mean I think my open question
32:11
to people is always you know what are you interested in in defi or what protocols are you using in
32:26
defi can maybe chip in with a little experience um I come from a country
32:33
where it's harder to save up because there's a lot of inflation and so um the
32:38
DSR has been or you know keeping my stable coins in defi has been a good way to go for me and I want I think for a
32:47
lot of other um people living in high inflation countries out there it's really a viable option it's one of the
32:54
really strong arguments about staying in D5 and I really like this route um in Defi
33:02
and I wonder what you think brave because you come from a different background and I wonder how defi has
33:08
played a role in your financial planning yeah I mean I I would say
33:15
there's a few different things um when I look I mean I look across defi all the
33:20
time just to look at what the yield landscape looks like you know looking at new Protocol New protocols to list on
33:26
Nexus Mutual um and a lot of what I look for is you know what is unique and
33:32
interesting um for myself if I personally deploy any funds somewhere you know I look at uh the level of
33:39
complexity um if I can you know just using something that I can deposit some stable coins into and earn somewhere
33:47
around the base rate if not a little bit higher than the base rate of yield this is kind of what I'm looking for uh but a
33:53
lot of times I'm looking for you know passive ways to deposit e somewhere and earn on my eth assets um like I
34:00
highlight in my state of defi yields report a lot of people like to trade um you know tokens back and forth to try
34:07
and make a profit but um you know I'm busy working I'm busy doing a million things so it's nice to to deposit you
34:14
know an eth correlated pair into like a beefy vaults and then you know generate
34:20
yield on my eth natively um and then of course I under write risk within the
34:25
mutual I have my own staking pool where I stake and and underr right risk um and I've been able to earn what is that
34:32
right now it's a little over 133% on my nxm and of course nxm is correlated to
34:37
eth because there's eth backing it in the capital pool so you know these are the main things that I'm doing but a lot
34:43
of stuff that I'm looking for is where can I earn on my Staples or on my eth
34:49
where I can kind of outperform certain areas of the market or or can I deposit stable coins to earn a rate that would
34:56
be similar to what I would earn let's say um you know in the US Stock Market but just you know by putting it into a
35:02
yield Optimizer something along those lines so that's personally you know what I do when I'm depositing into different
35:08
def protocols or what I'm looking for when I deposit in
35:14
Def thanks for sharing that bra I yeah I definitely feel like the passive side of
35:20
things is also quite interesting for myself as well and
35:26
um if no other listener has anything to chip in at this time I'd like to um ask
35:33
one last time if Brave you want to bring anything up or if there are any
35:39
questions yeah I think I think for my side there's just a couple things one is um we've added some new listings in the
35:45
UI this is in our newsletter too but I thought i' just run through some of them so we've added gearbox V3 that's been
35:51
very popular um for the usde and the liquid restak token leverage strategies
35:57
but if you you're just somebody who wants to deposit on the passive side for eth it spent over 20% uh you know
36:03
variable apy on eth and for usdc uh it's been like over 30% because
36:09
of the demand for leverage on the you know Athena strategy um FX protocol we
36:14
listed Camelot and aracas as well uh We've also listed Prisma which is a
36:20
protocol where you can mint the M how do it it mkd USD the the um
36:28
their's stable coin so you can put in liquid reaking tokens or other liquid staking tokens to Mint that um there's a
36:36
bunch of yield strategies through convex and different things like that for Prisma so we've listed Prisma we listed
36:42
PX eth as I mentioned um nft per and then Beethoven X as well have all been
36:47
listed uh in the Nexus Mutual UI and so you can buy cover on those and those will be added to open cover in the near
36:54
future as well and then just a reminder to come and you know join us on our interview tomorrow with uh Justin from
37:00
grid plus I think this going be really great if you don't already have a grid plus latus one um you can join and we're
37:07
going to do a raffle to give one of those away on the call as well so um definitely a great conversation and a
37:13
chance to win what is in my personal opinion the best Harbor wallet out there on the market so so yeah uh those are
37:20
the last points that I have to make before we kind of wrap things up and oh I see we have one
37:26
request
37:36
hello you should be able to unmute yourself and speak Alpha block yes hey
37:42
guys can you hear me yes we can how's it going very good very good I just wanted to chime in really briefly to say thank
37:49
you I think it was a really really comprehensive overview and most interesting so thank you so
37:55
much um and then I also this may be like a very basic question
38:00
but I'm I haven't been kind of following up with uh everything in in the Nexus
38:05
world so I just wonder if you could simplify like a what's the value
38:11
proposition here so I'm hearing these yields of 20 30% so if and then of
38:17
course the there is this all this contract risk so if I wanted to eliminate that risk with Nexus could you
38:24
say I'm kind of locking in like a lower risk yield and what is that number so if I start at
38:30
2025 once I'm covered what is my leftover yield that I'm collecting and
38:36
that I'm kind of locking in beyond smart contract risk is there a simple number to that
38:41
question yeah well it depends it depends on the strategy right but like if I go
38:47
back and I talk about like urine juice faults for example we have that th protocol cover right now that's priced
38:53
at about um 6.75 and so so if you're depositing into
38:59
the Dy Juiced vault which is around what did I say I think it's
39:05
36 I'll just check really quick um then you're talking around 29 to 30% on D
39:14
within yeah that is what it is it's uh it's just a little over 36 so you're talking about um roughly 30% uh variable
39:23
APR in the UR juice vaults if you're buying that bundle coverage which gives you protections against two underlying
39:28
protocols there for something like a um a V3 I think is around 5% is what people
39:37
are underrating it for um on within the mutual uh for something like Pendle it's
39:43
like 5.87% um for some of the other other
39:48
bundle products like beefy and curve and beefy and compound that is around like 5.8 so again it depends on some of the
39:55
yield opportunities but right um yeah it leaves a lot of room basically a lot of
40:01
room right yeah it leaves quite it leaves quite a bit of room um on on you know the majority of these so if if the
40:09
base yield is in the double digits you know you're G to have typically plenty of room um I think the only difference
40:16
is like I talked about with Dynamic pricing if there's a bunch of people that buy cover or one person that buys a
40:21
massive cover for something like pendall that'll shift that price back up and so you might have to wait you know days for
40:28
the price to come back down but but yeah generally speaking you know the pricing on cover is um you know pretty
40:35
affordable it just depends who's underwriting the risk because there's multiple different Underwriters and they set the iar you yeah uh it sounds like
40:43
an noer you know like with these yields like why would why wouldn't you do it you know you're cutting off dramatic
40:50
risk for little money it from what I'm hearing it sounds like a a really strong
40:55
value proposition guy so I think I'm going to look into it thank you yeah you're very welcome um and again uh if
41:02
you want to join the mutual as a member you can do that or if you just want to buy cover without going through kyc you
41:07
can do that through open cover um on base arbitrum or optimism as well and
41:13
one final question if I if I may sure so I seem to remember back in the day
41:18
hearing that at the end of the day Nexus um has an element that is kind of
41:24
locked in the contract but then there is a human decision at the end you know for for these claims so to what extent are you kind of
41:31
guaranteed that if the contract materializes you know the the the board
41:37
won't go Rogue or something you know and and then ultimately you you actually were taking more risk than you
41:43
realized I'm sure you get this question all the time or something like it yeah yeah we do um but but it's a good
41:49
question it's important to ask these questions so um there's two main things one of them is there's fraud protection
41:54
built into the claims process so not anybody can just go in and votee on claims one of the caveats is if you want
42:01
to vote as a claim assessor you have to stake nxm to vote on claims so if
42:07
somebody's going to go in and try to deny a legitimate claim they have to put in a certain amount of nxm the people
42:13
that are assessing these claims are looking at the validity of the claim they're not deciding do I want to pay this out or don't I so if it's very
42:20
clear like if it's a reentrancy attack and there's a loss of funds this would be something that's covered under the
42:27
protocol cover Provisions right this is an unintended use of a smart contract that results in a loss so someone votes
42:33
to deny that claim they're basically in breach right and that is um a fraudulent
42:38
assessment so there's two things that can that'll happen one of them is that The Advisory board can take action to
42:44
burn their nxm so if you've stake let's say 10 or $100,000 worth of nxm you're
42:49
going to lose that Capital the second thing is they can reverse their vote decision so if they are let's say um
42:56
somebody with a lot of vot weight that decides to vote then they're going to lose their capital and their ultimate
43:01
decision that they had voted with can be reversed by The Advisory board so you're basically trying to deny a claim by
43:09
putting up Capital that you're risking uh if you're caught which there's been one example of someone doing it and it
43:14
wasn't someone trying to deny a legitimate claim it was someone trying to push through okay oh I see I see so
43:23
yeah yeah but theoretically if if they coordinate it like I understand it like as a an as a oneof you it's like you
43:29
don't the incentive is for you not to do it but could like if something major happened could
43:35
theoretically ultimately there is a human layer right I'm I'm there is yeah yeah
43:41
so it's at the end of the day it's people who stake nxm and assess claims but if even if you have a lot of people
43:48
that coordinate Again The Advisory board has the power to burn that nxm stake so
43:53
it's not something that goes up to a vote it's uh you know just the Advisory Board which is five longtime um aligned
43:59
members that vote on these things the other thing is people who are acting as risk assessors that stake nxm and
44:06
underwrite risk they can't take that same capital and then stake it in in
44:11
risk assessment so if someone is trying to you know deny a legitimate claim they
44:17
thought to stake xxm in excess of what they have in risk assessment because that can't be used to vote on claims so
44:23
um the economic incentive just isn't there to deny a legitimate claim the other thing is when you're underwriting
44:29
risk you're basically sharing risk with other members of the mutual who are underwriting risk so your loss isn't going to be in total of you know what
44:35
claim payouts are it's going to be shared across to people that are underwriting this risk so um yeah the
44:41
economic incentive for you to deny legitimate claim just isn't there based on our fraud prevention
44:47
design that sounds uh really really cool and I just want to say something quick
44:53
that uh I think we're living some really interesting times and I know there is all this talk about uh meme coins and
45:00
and whatnot but I think what you're doing guys is like really incredible you know that there can be this algorithmic
45:07
system where people are underwriting risk to one another in a kind of in a rules based system provided by smart
45:13
contract that is incredible but somehow it's still not kind of what people are
45:19
appreciating so I just wanted to say congrats for for what you're doing guys and I hope there is more talk about Defi
45:24
and and a little bit less about meme coin world I I 100% agree I also think what
45:33
we do is fascinating and um yeah we're expanding the different kinds of risks that we're underwriting and um yeah I
45:39
mean yeah I'm very happy that uh that you enjoyed the call and that you're um enthusiastic about the mutual so if you
45:45
have any more questions after the call or you want to reach out on Discord just reach out to us and send us a message so
45:51
thanks so much thank you so much guys cheers
45:59
all right um yeah uh if there's nothing from anybody else then I think it's probably
46:05
about time Sam for us to wrap up the call we're about it time yeah we are thanks a lot guys this
46:11
has been really cool um it has been also great to hear your enthusiasm out the
46:17
block always happy to have you here on the call with any other questions or also on
46:23
Discord and um yeah thank thanks everybody for joining us today we're
46:29
going to meet again tomorrow for the covering defi interview series first episode with Justin from gri plus and
46:36
brave hope to see you there and hope also hope to see you in two weeks time for our community call again where we'll
46:43
recap the latest state of defi in yields and risk take care and see you around
46:52
bye bye everybody
