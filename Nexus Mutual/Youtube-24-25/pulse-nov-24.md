hey everyone and welcome to this week's D5 pulse by weekly report by Nexus
0:14
Mutual thrilled to have you all with us today we've got an exciting lineup on
Agenda
0:21
the agenda Brave New defi is here joining us from the Nexus Mutual main
0:26
account to share the latest insights in Def covering everything from yields to
0:32
risk Trends shaping the Space Foundation updates from H will
0:38
give us a deeper look into our new partnership with Native and what it means for the
0:44
mutual you will also share the latest updates from engineering BD and the
0:50
foundation teams I will be unveiling our new community dashboard on Doom diving
0:56
into Howard amplifies transparency at next mutual and of course stick around for
1:04
your PO app at the end let's dive in Brave what's new in
State of DeFi
1:14
defi thanks Sam yeah uh good morning everybody normally I start off with an
1:19
overview of the markets before diving into the yield landscape but I think it's safe to say that everybody on this
1:25
call knows the major Catalyst that's driving uh the uptick in the market and the massive uh weekly green candle that
1:32
we've seen on the majors we went from a crab market to kind of a a really white
1:38
hot Market in a matter of two weeks after the US election results came out so that bullish trend is reflected
1:45
across most of the major derivative exchanges as leverage Traders are paying
1:51
um shorts between 22% and 70% apy to go long on eth uh for the last several
1:57
months funding rates have hovered between 10% apy to 15% to go along on E
2:04
so now we're seeing rate Spike as Traders increase their appetite for leverage that's also what's driving uh
2:10
the increase in yields on major lending markets in defi as well so it looks like
2:16
we're moving into the next phase of the market cycle which some have argued is the end of the excitement phase or the beginning of the Euphoria phase if
2:23
you're not familiar with that you can look up on Google like the Wall Street cheat sheet for the psychology of a
2:29
market Market cycle um but right now we're kind of heading up the curve
2:35
toward the uh the top of the market um and it's kind of up for debate which section that we're in but uh but yeah
2:42
definitely the market is taking off and yields are kind of reflecting that so as the market continues to heat up just
2:48
keep in mind a few things um if you're trading just remember to take profit
2:53
periodically uh this kind of from my own perspective after being around for a couple Cycles be sure that you can pay
2:59
your bill bills in real life that's really really important be careful with leverage it's really tempting to deposit
3:05
eth on a borrow stables and then buy more eth but if the market goes down and you get liquidated you're going to lose
3:10
months or years of hard work and have little left to show for it so be careful with leverage and don't use so much that
3:17
you worry about leaving your computer for hours at a time you don't want to be chained to your computer for an entire
3:22
Market cycle uh be safe out there when you're looking at yields so if you see
3:27
really high apy going of be suspicious and do little research just remember that 1,000% API on0 is still Z so if
3:36
something sounds too good to be true be suspicious do your own research instead of just taping into something uh don't
3:43
trade more than you can afford to lose and if you're seeing people tweeting about things on Twitter also be
3:50
suspicious um that's a common thing that you'll see is people recommending this or that but a lot of times they're just
3:56
trying to promote their own bags um so just be really careful where you get your information from what you're
4:02
looking at and kind of you know what you're seeing as far as apis uh in a bull market exploits tend
4:10
to typically ramp up because the incentive for black hats is much higher as the prices of assets go up so buy
4:16
covers that suit your need to protect yourself against hacks and exploits um
4:21
there's just a greater chance that people are going to be finding vulnerabilities as the value of the TBL
4:27
and these protocols ramps up so don't let a hack ruin the bull market for you I mean the easiest way to protect
4:33
against getting hacked or suffering you know from A Loss to even an exploit is just to buy cover so at Nexus Mutual we
4:39
have lots and lots of options but let's talk a little bit about the yield landscape and defi right now uh I have
4:47
been looking at vaults FYI for The Benchmark rates so I used to manually calculate the onchain base rate that I
4:54
put in my newsletter but false FYI has started doing this for me anybody can check on those Benchmark yields for USD
5:01
and Ethan their site they use the average across the major lending markets to calculate that so this week the USD
5:08
Benchmark rate has climbed to 6.45% apy which is a little more than um 2% lower
5:15
than the sky savings rate on usds through Sky protocol uh the sky savings
5:21
rate recently went up to 88.5% and the die savings rate recently went up 7.5% so that usually sets some
5:29
of the flors for Lending as people Arbitrage that rate back and forth so I think we can expect to see lending rates
5:35
rise a little bit more to to match those rates um The Benchmark rate for USD
5:41
though is also over 2% higher than current US Treasury yields so the wider
5:47
that spread is between US Treasury yields and onchain yields the more likely we'll see greater inflows coming
5:52
onchain into def5 the Benchmark rate for eth is at 3.17% which is in line with the average
5:59
yield available across E Liquid staking tokens there's quite a few yield opportunities in defi right now where
6:06
you can earn far greater than the Benchmark rate for both eth and USD I'll highlight some of those examples in a
6:13
bit but I wanted to talk a little bit about the role of Leverage in a bull market I've had some people ask me
6:18
questions about this and I've talked back and forth with a few people on Twitter recently about lending yields on
6:24
a so somebody had asked why the interest rates on the arbit from a V3 Market
6:29
Market were so much higher than other a markets um at one given time and why the
6:35
interest rates have jumped and you know why they're not being arbitraged back to
6:41
some baseline um but if you you know look at those markets they do get
6:47
arbitraged over time so because I've seen this come up a few times I thought I'd just talk about this before talking
6:53
more about yield strategies and some of those include protocols that use leverage so when the market takes off
7:00
people use lending markets to leverage their crypto assets for a variety of reasons some people want to maintain their exposure to eth and other assets
7:06
without selling so they borrow Stables against their collateral to pay you know expenses in real life um some people
7:15
want to create a leverage long position by depositing eth borrowing Stables buying more eth depositing that as
7:21
collateral and repeating the process uh this is like a a looping leverage strategy um there are other protocols
7:27
that automate that process like summer Kango instad dap lights um but with
7:33
leverage that's going to uh introduce greater risk in your position as well um and then there are people that are
7:40
farming on yield bearing assets like usde sde ssds um and what they're trying to do is
7:47
increase the returns by using a looping strategy kind of like I described with eth they can amplify the amount of yield
7:53
they're earning by just borrowing and kind of looping um looping up their
7:59
collateral so they can borrow more and then earn more yield and then just use that yield to pay off the interest rate
8:05
on their borrowed assets uh av3 has you know emoe with like kind assets so
8:12
people can get really high efficiency in lending the same with things on like Moro and fluid they have markets with
8:19
higher loan to value thresholds for stable to stable boring as well so all of this demand this appetite for
8:26
leverage on eth and greater demand for stable coin assets and yield bearing
8:31
assets that drives those interest rates for borrowers and lenders on these
8:36
markets but they always end up Arbitrage back so if you actually look on a or even if you look on vault FYI you can
8:43
see like the average over A month's time or a 7-Day time frame and they're all averaged down to about the same rate
8:50
which over the last month has been between five and six% so you'll see like a 30-day average yield on certain assets
8:58
is going to tend to be the same for most Stables um within about 2% on major
9:04
markets like a so they do get Arbitrage back but it's just where people are borrowing against their assets so if
9:11
people have the majority of their Assets in arbitrum they're going to borrow there other people are going to leverage
9:16
back and forth um but as more people borrow eth and stable coin assets um
9:24
those interest rates tend to spike During certain periods like during the US election week usdc on the a ethereum
9:31
market spiked to like 60% plus apy uh because people began borrowing enough of
9:36
the usdc liquidity to drive utilization well above 90% and the way that A's
9:42
interest rates work is once utilization climbs over 90% then those rates start
9:48
to increase and then that has this push and pull effect on the yield so as the yields higher there's a greater
9:55
incentive for people to deposit more liquidity to bring back down those rates into to attract more liquidity since
10:01
there's greater demand for um stable coins and other Assets in those
10:07
markets so that's really kind of what drives leverage in a market especially in an
10:12
upwards Market but when there's more leverage in the market uh at
10:18
whole then this kind of creates more volatility when there's movements in price so if the price moves down uh and
10:25
liquidations are triggered this can kind of have this uh effect where there's Force selling where
10:32
as assets are being liquidated in Mass it's going to drive down prices because
10:37
those markets are deleveraging that also increases risk that there might be a bad debt scenario or something in a market
10:44
um so when I talk about leverage increasing risk I'm kind of talking about some of these things is if there
10:49
is a big flash crash where you know the price of e drops 30% in in a few hours
10:56
that's going to put stress on a lot of these lending protocols and all of these other protocols that you know are kind
11:01
of automating these looping strategies so when you're looking at something like
11:08
forced selling which again is like Mass liquidations um I recently saw an example of forced selling uh on through
11:15
extra so extra is a yield farming protocol in base and they have these pairs where you can basically yield farm
11:23
with leverage on Aerodrome so you can earn pretty high yields but you're taking on the risk of Leverage uh there
11:29
were people that were yield farming with I I believe it was ovn and e um but
11:35
there was an ovn either ether stable coin pair that people were using leverage to farm and
11:42
the price of ovn dropped from $40 per token to about $10 in a short time frame
11:50
uh it since dropped down to like five or $6 in the last couple of weeks but what
11:55
happened during this liquidation event is users on extra Finance were leverage farming with ovn and there was a drop
12:02
from $40 down to 35 that triggered liquidations for some larger
12:07
users so as it you know there was deleveraging in that market it led to ovm being sold off which further dropped
12:14
the price and triggered more liquidations and so this kind of LED this Cascade of liquidations on extra Pi
12:21
there was no bad debt created but this did have a negative impact on the price of the ovn token since it dropped so
12:28
much a short period of time so when you're looking at assets that you're
12:34
yield farming with you want to make sure there's enough liquidity out there so that if there is a Cascade of liquidations it's not going to have you
12:41
know a really catastrophic impact on price like you see here uh in this example because you know that is a
12:48
scenario where bad debt could be created fortunately though on extra 5 there was no bad debt everything worked as
12:54
intended it was just unfortunate for those that were farming in that particular market so leverage plays a
13:01
really important role in Bull markets uh Leverage is a useful tool in a lot of the yield strategies you see in defi but
13:09
it also creates a lot more volatility when the price of major assets go down and significant volatility for lower
13:14
market cap assets so again just remember to be careful when you use leverage and ensure you have a solid buffer with your
13:20
health Factor on any lending protocol but looking at the notable yields let's talk a little bit about
13:26
some of the onchain yields that are available uh I'll go over some onchain yields But be sure to do your own
13:32
research and determine what's suitable for your own risk profile uh I'll start with some eth based yields since I know
13:38
a lot of people are looking for ways to grow their eth stack at the moment personally I've been provided liquidity for correlated assets on dexes to earn
13:44
yield on my eth over the last several months so when you LP eth and another
13:50
correlated asset like a liquid staking token whether that's r e or wrapped stth
13:56
or some other uh liquid staking token a liquid reaking token like uh wrapped e
14:02
or easy eth you can earn yield without suffering significant and permanent loss
14:08
so that's the difference between what you would have earned if you just have the Assets in your wallet versus what you earned as a liquidity provider on a
14:14
DEX so when you're providing liquidity you're always buying one asset when the demand for the other is higher vice
14:21
versa so if you're lping a non-correlated pair like eth and usdc
14:27
you're selling eth when demand for eth is high and buying usdc when demand for Staples is lower relative to eth so you
14:34
can earn trading fees but you have less exposure to eth and if the price of eth drops and people are selling you're
14:40
buying eth when demand for Stables is higher and people are willing to sell their e so that's what's nice about
14:47
correlated pair is you can earn trading fees without the downside of significant impermanent loss there's a lot of great
14:54
dexes out there but there's a few correlated eth pairs where the yield has been high in the last day and week um
15:01
the re e and we pair on Unis swap V3 on ethereum uh in the
15:06
0.05% range daily apy for that has been pretty large so 188% and the monthly apy
15:13
the average over the last month has been 12% uh for the we and puffer eth pair on
15:20
curve on ethereum The Daily apy has been 56% and the monthly apy has been
15:26
11% uh for CBE we for the 0.01% pair uh on pancake swap on base
15:35
daily apy there has been 21% and the average over the last month has been right around the same range
15:41
22% and easy eth and we in the 0.01% pair um on pancake swap on base the
15:49
daily apy here has been 25% and the monthly apy has been 26% so there's been
15:54
some really really high yields on correlated to eth pairs on
16:00
uh and that's because more people are looking to buy eth or some of these lsts or lrts as the Market's picking up so
16:07
there's a lot of different options you can look on defi llama under yields and filter for dexas and like no one
16:14
permanent loss and you know you can see some of these pairs pop up so it's a really great tool um that's what I use
16:20
to put together a lot of the information uh I've also been lping some wxm and we
16:25
on Unis swap B3 in the 0.3% pool on ethereum since the yields have been quite High uh for a while now that's the
16:33
major uh source of liquidity for uh wxm at the moment so since wxm is
16:39
effectively correlated to nxm book's Book value in eth it's a like kind asset in eth terms the daily apy since the
16:47
volumes have been pretty big going through that pool is 228 per and the monthly apy is 76% over the last 30 days
16:55
so that's been very high too but if you're looking to uh earn yield on your eth using
17:03
leverage you can go two routes you can use a protocol like Taos Finance which is built on top of D hedge Tauros has
17:09
Vols that automatically rebalance so you don't have to worry about having your position liquidated uh this is a really
17:14
easy way to get leverage exposure to things they offer several eth and BTC leverage vaults on optimism arbitr and
17:21
base as well as some vaults that short Ethan BTC as well I've been really impressed by the toos team the last year
17:27
is they've grown their tvl considerably and become a pretty large major protocol on many ethereum l2s and you can use a
17:34
protocol like Arcadia Kango or extra Finance where you could Farm leverage yields across major dexes and lending
17:41
markets to earn Amplified yields with these strategies though you have to ensure your position remains profitable
17:46
and that the borrowing costs don't exceed the yield you're earning um you can also get liquidated on these protocols so they require more
17:53
maintenance than a protocol like toos Finance uh and of course you can always deposit on major lending markets like a
17:59
Moro fluid or moonwell to earn between 1% to 7% apy on your eth or eth related
18:06
assets so more aggressive yield farming strategies are out there but you can do your own research on daps like Arcadia
18:12
Kango extra Finance Taos Finance ex ether F liquid vaults and others so if
18:20
you want to earn on eth there's countless opportunities right now in defi um again that defi llama yields
18:26
page is uh really indispens as a resource uh but if you're looking to earn yield on your stable coins there's
18:33
plenty to do on chain to grow your stable coin Holdings the Ling markets are the simplest way to grow your stable
18:38
coin stack so usdt lenders on gearbox have earned an average of 16% on their
18:43
deposits over the last week usdc lenders on instap fluid have earned 16% on their
18:49
deposits over the last week depositors in the rd7 usdt morphal vault have
18:55
earned 177% over the last week and usdc lenders across moonwell fluid and Arcadia have
19:01
earned between 15 to 16% over the last week stable coin lenders and the a markets tend to earn between 5% to 12%
19:09
depending on utilization levels this varies across usdc usdt usds and die
19:15
yield aggregators allow you to farm with your Stables too but these vaults do all the hard work again I'll highlight Taos
19:21
Finance which has several vaults across different networks that have had high yields over the last week looking at the
19:27
Perpetual Delta neutral yield on optimism so this Vault uh generates
19:32
yield by taking a delta neutral position on BTC using a and Quenton synthetics so
19:39
the weekly yield there has been really high it's 79% and the month the average yield over the last month has been
19:45
40% the synthetics usdc Andromeda yield vaults on base um again the weekly yield
19:52
there has been high at 77% and the monthly yield has been uh consistently high around 23%
19:59
so this one you uses the usdc dep deposit liquidity into synthetics P3 on
20:06
base and then depositors earn snx rewards and trading fees and liquidation fees these are all liquidated back into
20:12
the usdc and then that's used to grow the balance in the vault beefy Vance
20:17
also has a lot of different options so Bey is a reliable protocol for farming yields across different networks the
20:24
beefy vaults automatically harvest the yields and reinvest rewards in the underlying yields to strategy they usdc
20:30
usdt Vault and arbitrum which earns yield on pancake swap using B's concentrated liquidity manager uh the
20:38
current apy there is 16% it's been I think consistent over the last month and then
20:44
the um there's another Vault that uses cam a lot with the same pair usdc usdt
20:50
on arbitrum um that also uses the concentrated liquidity manager and the apy there is
20:56
13% so there's a lot of different options in the yield aggregator markets
21:02
um but uh I did want to mention one more thing before I wrap up my review of onchain yields I want to take a minute
21:09
to talk about instap fluid which is a interesting lending protocol that shipped earlier this year so fluid is
21:15
created by the instap team um they' created instap lights and instap pro
21:20
it's an interface that's made it very easy to deposit into lending markets and to do some more complicated um Leverage
21:28
loopings strategies uh so they've been building this lending primitive for years and
21:33
they shipped it earlier this year and fluid is a pretty Innovative lending protocol so I've been doing some
21:40
research on this uh beyond the listing that we did here at Nexus and so fluid
21:45
allows you to create vaults where you can lend assets like usdc usdt eth and
21:51
other major crypto assets so once you create a position in your Vault you can borrow against your collateral um so the
21:57
way vaults are set up it's almost like you know an isolated Market a little bit
22:03
um and when you create a vaults and you want to borrow against it the ux in their uh dap is very intuitive so if you
22:12
want to supply eth as collateral and you want to borrow usdc against your eth the UI is going to show you the eth price at
22:18
which your position is going to be liquidated if the price of eth drops uh which is a really nice feature their
22:24
vaults have a higher collateral factor and liquidation threshold than you know some of the other lending protocols and
22:31
they handle liquidations differently than most other lending protocols as well because they have their own liquidity
22:37
layer um but for liquidations they handle liquidations similar to a curve
22:43
llama lend um that uses soft liquidations so what that means is that fluid is only going to liquidate enough
22:49
of your collateral to bring your position back below that liquidation threshold so instead of liquidating your
22:55
entire collateral balance they're only going to liquidate enough to bring you back back to a suitable Health Factor so
23:00
you can maintain your position uh the liquidation penalties on fluid are also lower than a lot of other lending
23:06
markets so they average between 1 to 3% depending on the different markets um so
23:11
they've kind of done some Innovative things on the leting market side but the big thing that they've shipped recently
23:16
and they've been talking about is they have their own decks and so this decks
23:22
allows you to LP your collateral or your debt so there are vaults that have Smart collateral enabled or smart debt enabled
23:30
and that means that you can earn additional trading fees on top of the interest that you're earning on your collateral or you can earn trading fees
23:36
on your debt and actually offset the cost if you're dead so I still need to dig into the technical docs for fluid's
23:42
new decks but because they have this in-house deck that they've built it
23:47
allows fluid to process more efficient liquidations and then create competitive lending and boring markets so they're
23:53
working to integrate their decks with major aggregators to Route more volume through the fluid deck
23:59
which is going to increase trading fees for LPS so you know if you have debt in
24:04
usdc and the rate is high but you're earning a decent amount of trading fees that offsets your debt it's just you
24:12
know allowing your liquidity in The Lending Market to be more efficient and to be earning in more places for you so
24:17
it's a pretty novel design and it's been noticed by quite a few people so I've been pretty impressed there's always a
24:23
massive amount of innovation happening in The Lending sector and I'm really excited to see fluid's growth and additional features so we do have fluid
24:30
protocol cover available for anybody who wants to deposit into fluid while protecting against smart contract and
24:36
economic risks I'll try to highlight other interesting protocols I come across in my research on future calls if
24:41
that's something that uh folks are interested in but um I just wanted to note that because I've been looking into
24:46
fluid and I think it's a pretty cool protocol but I wanted to talk a little bit about the D5 pass cover launch as
Base DeFi Pass
24:54
well so while onchain yields are heating up I wanted to just share an update on the base defi pass so we launched this
25:01
new product several weeks ago and we've seen consistent cover buys come through from open cover the feedback that we've
25:07
received has been overwhelmingly positive I've had users share that takes away the guesswork of understanding what
25:13
is and isn't covered in a protocol that uses underlying protocols to generate yield so if you're not familiar with the
25:19
Bas T5 pass here's a quick tldr so the base defi pass provides
25:24
protection against smart contract and economic risk across the largest protocol in the base ecosystem including
25:30
Aerodrome Arcadia beefy compound V3 extra Finance moonwell Moro and Moro
25:36
vaults override finance and Unis swap B3 all the same protections that you get in
25:41
protocol cover but more comprehensive protection and greater flexibility so you can move assets between all these
25:47
protocols while maintaining your coverage and it also provides the same protections for each of the underlying
25:53
protocols that are used to generate yield in the list of all these protocols s so that means that you could buy a
26:00
base defi pass deposit into B and earn yield without worrying about whether or not the underlying yield source is
26:06
covered if there's a hack in that underlying yield source so we've designed this product to be as simple as
26:11
possible for you when you're buying cover to protect your defi deposits yields in the covered protocols
26:17
have been on the rise as well with lending yields ranging from 10 to 16% and some of the lending protocols
26:22
included in the Bas D5 pass yields on beefy and other yield aggregators included in the pass are also in the
26:28
double digits so there's a lot of yield opportunities on base right now um and so I think this Bas def5 pass has been
26:35
really helpful for newer users coming on Shain and some other users that just want greater flexibility when they're
26:40
buying cover so as the market takes off and he are on the rise on Bas be sure to take a
26:46
look at the Bas def5 pass you can learn more about the Bas def5 pass in open cover's website at open cover.com and
26:53
you can see a link to the Bas defi pass highlighted in the banner um but yeah we
26:58
I think have about three million in active cover on the Bas def5 pass and it's been pretty popular to start I
27:04
imagine that'll be the case as more people come across this and Discover it as well and then before I hand things
Governance Updates
27:10
over to H I just wanted to give a short update on a governance item so I wanted to note that I'm going to be posting a
27:16
governance proposal on the Forum later today that outlines pricing parameter changes and added pricing functionality
27:22
for fixed price public listings so this proposal is related to some new products
27:28
we development with one product nearing the soft launch stage I'll be proposing
27:33
that members Grant The Advisory Board the power to reduce the global minimum price from 1% to
27:39
0.1% uh decrease the price bump ratio parameter from 20 to five to reduce the
27:45
rate at which a listing's price increases after a large cover by uh to remove the surge pricing from the
27:52
protocol's existing price calculations so this would be if utilization for a staking pool got about 90% that price
27:59
would spike um we're going to we're looking to remove that if this is approved um and then we're also looking
28:06
to create functionality for public fixed price listings that any pool manager can stake against uh and with this
28:13
functionality to set a minimum price at the listing level so that if we have things like the base defi pass or these
28:19
products that we can list it and let any sticking pool manager stick against to provide capacity but to ensure that
28:26
because it's uh fixed price listing that there's s of race to the bottom where people are just constantly lowering the price so we set a price floor and then
28:34
from there Stak and pool managers can price that product you know at whatever range they would like as long as it's at
28:40
or above that floor level all of these changes will allow us to provide users with a better cover buying experience
28:47
reduce pricing for some battle tested listings and remain competitive on certain product types like eat slashing
28:53
while supporting new uh product development I'll have more information in my post that I share on the Forum
28:59
later today um but does anybody have any questions before we move
29:09
on okay if not I will turn things over to Hugh to give the foundation update
Foundation Team Updates
29:17
you cool thanks Brave um yeah quite a few things going on um on our side on
29:23
yeah on the foundation side I'll start with the the native deal which was announced a few weeks back
29:28
um and just kind of give you a bit more flavor about um how how that works and um and kind of why why we decided to do
29:35
it so I guess the first thing is it's the Investments been made out of um the Nexus Mutual Foundation which um is a
29:42
legal entity in the in the UK Collective risk Services um and it's um it's
29:49
basically the the original entity that kind of employs most most of the the developers and and a chunk of the team
29:55
um so why do we decide to to make the investment well the native team are a
30:01
group of about eight crypto digital asset Insurance Specialists they they've
30:06
they've been working um mostly together as a um the main people that um have
30:12
been working together as part of superscript previously um and they're kind of a they had a digital set broking
30:18
um Insurance broking team there and they've been very successful and kind of one of the best um teams in in the space
30:25
about building a um good portfolio so what they do is they primarily um look
30:30
to get coverage for businesses that operate within the crypto sphere so that
30:36
might be like BTC miners or service companies or um exchanges a whole bunch
30:41
of other different different companies so then haven't been necessarily focused on like protocols Etc but more on the
30:47
businesses that operate within crypto and get them the right insurance needs from mainly traditional markets so
30:53
that's where the their background is coming from um so get them things like you know liability coverages dno um
31:00
crime all that type of usual business stuff um and so they've been they've been really strong there what and what
31:07
we've noticed um in in those particular markets is there's not um enough capacity to serve all the needs um and
31:14
so there's going to be a need to um or we think there's an opportunity for Nexus in particular to deploy some of
31:22
its existing Capital base into into backing those types of deals um and so primarily what we're looking to do is
31:28
kind of um provide in the initial stages provide like follow on type coverage so
31:33
where someone wants say um 30 million of coverage and the traditional markets can only source them say 10 or 15 then maybe
31:41
Nexus could come in and fill out the rest um on on similar terms and so um
31:46
what we've done here is like it's really a partnership to grow out the distribution of of the mutual um and so
31:54
I'm pretty really pretty excited about this I've been a team for quite a while um been kind of talking for for many
31:59
years I guess um but the the time was right when they decided to kind of spin out and set up their own their own
32:05
Venture and where I'm very I'm very happy to kind of back them um so they've
32:10
they've launched they've got all their licenses in place to sell um Insurance um regulated Insurance business um but
32:16
they're looking to also partner and create um opportunities for onchain risk um and you would have seen that they've
32:22
actually created a staking pool on Nexus um so they're kind of getting ready to go and and they're they're building up
32:29
their um pipeline of customers and stuff um just post post launch a few weeks ago so um hopefully we can see some really
32:36
good things come um from native in in 2025 so kind really excited about this partnership but um I guess we it'll
32:42
takes a little while to wind up so expecting some some more of attraction to happen in 2025 um so that's been pretty cool I
32:49
think um more specifically on the Nexus side of things I guess the um like Trump
32:57
winning um a few weeks back has definitely changed things I think the one thing from my perspective is apart
33:03
from seeing a lot more just general inbounding questions is that the uncertainty on regulations that has been
33:11
plaguing the industry for quite a while now um it's definitely been holding um people back it's been keeping
33:17
traditional capital on the sidelines um it's definitely it's created all these questions and people say like you know
33:22
it's not the right time for us Etc we wait and see what happens and a lot that's that's obviously the tide seem to
33:28
be changing now and and you know that that's given the um I guess more positive outlook from the US um other um
33:36
countries often tend to follow um the US on regulation like this so um so generally people are much more willing
33:42
to have those conversations they're actively reaching out um doesn't mean things are going to change immediately don't know but um you know I think um I
33:51
think the direction of travel is is very positive and a lot of conversations and
33:56
potential deals are into happening than than before when it was kind of like no we just want to
34:01
definitely stay away that's a bad that type of stuff so um
34:06
so positive just general um a feeling in the market and um and feel like there's
34:12
going to good opportunities come um out of this over over the next year so
34:19
yeah well um from the kind of team side we had a um a full team get together in
34:26
um in Paris a few weeks back um and the main kind of thing there was obviously just get together as a team syon a whole
34:31
bunch of stuff we're kind of Glo we're Global team so it's um always good to get in meet everyone in person but
34:38
basically Hing out the medium-term ro road map about what we're doing um and so we I want to share more on this in
34:45
terms of specifics but um you would have heard Brave talk about a bunch of smaller protocol enhancements especially
34:50
around pricing so um they're kind of smaller tweaks but that we think we can ship quite quickly um that we think can
34:57
also make a a decent difference especially as yields start increasing um within Di and so the demand for cover
35:03
should also increase we've seen that every single time so um we want to be in the best position we can be um I think
35:10
more generally we're actually in a really good position with the the fundamentals of the protocol there um it's just about getting out um
35:16
increasing the distribution and um and seeing and getting the yields up and seeing seeing the yields rise and then
35:22
obviously um getting the cover to back that um so sorry there was a bit of a tangent but I'm getting back to the the
35:28
get together um and the road map so I guess some bigger chunker pieces of work
35:35
around l2s there's also governance um revamp Etc but um and there's also some
35:42
um some new product launches that um we'll look to share more broadly as um soon as well so I think a lot of
35:49
interesting stuff we're looking to give you more insight on that once we just get it in a nice sharable form um but it
35:55
was really good to sink on the team there's a lot of energy coming out um off the back of that um get together and
36:01
um there's a lot of momentum so um I think with the markets team's in a good
36:06
spot I think the team's in a great spot um probably the best spot we've ever been in to be honest um and so I think
36:12
we're really really well positioned more generally um especially with the yield environment and I guess the more
36:18
positive um kind of bull market happening so yeah excited about that um
36:24
also probably worth just just noting we're going to do a bit more of a wider announcement on this but you may have
36:29
seen that like CB BTC is now um live as a cover pitches asset um on the um the
36:35
protocol which is pretty cool um I think the um one of the really interesting
36:40
things here is that the the whole BTC staking raking type um Market we think
36:46
that that's going to be a decent um there's decent opportunities there um there's also um and this kind of goes
36:53
back to the native stuff there are also a lot of potential um a lot of potential
36:58
users that want to buy cover in BTC so BTC minus being a particular one that
37:04
struggled to get BTC denominated coverage from traditional Insurance that's basically not available um so
37:10
coming to um to Nexus to purchase BTC denominated covers um is pretty big um especially when we can do it at at
37:17
decent sizes that meaningful to them also exchangers often tend to want to buy some of their coverage in in BTC
37:23
term so um so that's interesting um as as well so I think there's um it's
37:30
useful for both the people looking to earn yield on BTC but also um I guess
37:35
more broadly um for the kind of more traditional businesses within the crypto space so yeah um keep keep an eye on
37:42
that and and have a look at the opportunities on BTC with the reaking who knows where it's going to go exactly
37:48
but um there seems to be a lot of effort being put in the wider industry on it so that's probably something to to keep an
37:53
eye on um for the future um yeah that's it's a lot of stuff but um but yeah
37:59
pretty excited just in general with where we're at and um I guess looking forward to the the coming weeks and months and see where this um where the
38:06
market goes so um yeah happy to take happy to take questions on on any all of
