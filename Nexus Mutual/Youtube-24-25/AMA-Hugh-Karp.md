Hello everybody and welcome to Defi Ask Me Anything with Hugh. Last month as we
0:09
started the first cohort of the DeFi and risk learning group, our cohort participants asked some interesting
0:15
questions on Nexus Mutual forum. You may find them at
0:20
forum.nexusmutual.io IO and then you go to the top right to the search function
0:26
and type D5 AMA. If you have any further questions,
0:31
please make sure to post them. We will be doing another round of D5 AMAs with
0:37
further uh team members. But um for now, we'll get things started with
0:44
you. We're going to go one by one. I am simply mirroring my tab here and we have
0:52
about 15 users posting their questions but the questions are a bit long. We'll
0:58
see how how much of them we'll cover in the next 45 minutes or so and uh
1:04
continue with the rest of the questions in another episode of the D5
1:11
AMA. You're welcome. Before we start, any notes or should we just dive in? No.
1:17
Cool. Thanks. Thanks for having me on, Tim. Yeah. No, lot lots of really good questions. So, I'm keen to keen to get
1:23
stuck in. Um, I'll try and summarize some of them and some of them are quite deep, but um we'll we'll we'll go into
1:30
them as much as possible. Thank you. And also, thanks for doing
1:35
this. I think it's uh it's it's it's probably going to be packed with a lot of insight. So, I'm always looking
1:42
forward to your answers. Okay, let's start with Jack's questions. The first question that he
Risks of trading real-world assets onchain (Jack)
1:49
asks is about the risks of trading real world assets on chain.
1:56
Yeah. So, I think there's a whole there's a bunch of things to consider here. Um, the first thing is kind of the
2:02
technical risk of the smart contracts failing, which is kind of like I guess a well-known a relatively well-known risk
2:08
now. Um it's also one I guess one of the key things that Nexus covers. Um but that's kind of one aspect. And then the
2:14
other main aspect is when you're trading real world assets. Um essentially you
2:19
tokenize something um off offchain. And the only way you can really kind of
2:25
tokenize that appropriately is through uh through kind of legal agreements in
2:30
general um or a trust of a centralized entity. Um, and so really what you're
2:35
doing is you're um using the the trading capabilities of the blockchain world um
2:42
but it's really underpinned by the legal or um custody situation of the offchain
2:48
assets. So um so the smart contract layer um it can definitely be covered
2:53
etc. But it's probably depending on the real world asset. It really depends on how it's set up, what the custody is,
2:58
how clear the legal arrangements are and that type of thing. So that's kind of the the general um risks there. For
3:04
example, um with US um DC um you're effectively trusting Circle to manage
3:10
assets and have enough backing for the USDC that it mints. um and for other
3:16
things like I don't know someone might tokenize um real estate on the on the blockchain or something in which case um
3:23
how what rights do the token holders actually have in the legal contracts of
3:28
um the um the real estate that's backed and so those are the types of things to consider
3:34
um in terms of the I guess the next one and kind of delving into this in a bit
TradFi adopting blockchain vs decentralization (Jack)
3:39
more detail like um in I guess more generally like what
3:45
traditional finance um adopting blockchain technology. What risks does it um does it face? Um I I think one of
3:52
the things in general there is the it kind of comes back to this legal centralization issue. You you're kind of
3:59
in a hybrid world where you've got some centralization aspects um and then
4:04
you've got the kind of trading and tokenization running on the blockchain aspect. So you've got kind of two sides
4:10
to the thing. Um, and so that's quite fine like if people want to participate
4:16
in that. Um, it's not going to be it's going to be hard to make it fully decentralized and that's perhaps impossible in a lot of these um, real
4:23
world asset type things. Um, but if we're talking about I guess Trafy more general adopting the technology that to
4:28
me they're just another user base. Um, and so I don't necessarily think in and
4:34
of itself there's a threat to decentralization. the the threat can really happen where you've got one or a
4:43
few assets that are really large that are effectively centralized like USDC or
4:49
USDT tether um something like that could pose some decentralization risk for
4:55
example if there's a contentious fork um of the underlying blockchain and you
5:00
have to kind of choose which fork or which branch of the fork to take then
5:05
effectively because um you have a centralized entity controlling the real
5:11
assets offchain, they're the ones that could influence the fork choice. Um and
5:16
so to the extent that there's only a few of those parties, they could effectively provide us um contribute to a
5:22
centralizing force. Um, and and I think you kind of see that now like if there was a contentious fork in Ethereum then
5:29
and and Circle decided to make a forced choice about which one it wanted rather
5:34
than just passively seeing what played out um then they could influence the um the choice because assets on one side of
5:42
the fork will be worth nothing because they wouldn't have any asset backing and assets on the other side of the fork, the one that circle chose um would be
5:48
the ones that be worth something. So, so that's kind of the um I guess some of
5:53
the kind of higher level existential type risks that that kind of exist when you have large um institutions or large
6:01
um users getting in involved um on the I guess on the next one. So,
Crypto as store of value (Jack)
6:10
yeah. So, how can we promote a deeper understanding of crypto as currency as a store of value? This
6:17
one's I think there's a there's a lot of work you have to do here and it's kind of um there's a big kind of Lindy effect
6:24
as in things that are there for longer become more established and so I kind of
6:29
feel like Bitcoin's got there um and others have yet to get there. I
6:36
obviously hope Ethereum gets there, but personally, but um and I think it will, but um but I think um Bitcoin is
6:42
probably the only real one that's got there. And honestly, this is kind of a
6:47
time um just time and trust and it's been built up over um the steady time. I
6:55
guess there's a whole bunch of in in effect community-led marketing and and and things. So, you know, I think
7:00
Bitcoin's been relatively successful around this whole like store of value or um gold um digital gold. So, you know, I
7:08
think that kind of um plays into it. So, you know, this is kind of grassroots time and it's there's no kind of quick
7:16
quick win here. This takes it takes a lot of time and effort.
7:22
Thanks you. Let's move on with Mos's questions. most focus on focuses on
7:31
teams building for failure and looks beyond tech. I I like the question. He
7:37
asks, "How can founders build resilience by designing for failure and by not just
7:46
relying on audits or bug bounties?"
Designing for failure (Moss
7:51
Yeah, I think um I think there's a lot of expertise in the industry now that um
7:56
and they people try to do this um one of the so I think there's basically
8:02
security is is like this the Swiss cheese approach um basically you have lots of different layers and each layer
8:08
effectively has a hole in it but hopefully not all of the holes line up and you've got protection. So that's
8:13
kind of um that's kind of the thing we should be thinking about and there's always extra layers of security. um
8:20
things like um there's the monitoring systems, there's bug bounties, there's audits, there's um
8:27
there's a whole bunch of different things there that um most of the high quality teams definitely use. Um in
8:34
terms of like um intentionally like designing for failure like there's
8:40
there's kind of this rabbit hole type approach where like you can always add on an extra layer and perhaps it makes a
8:45
system more complex etc. But I think um I think one of the most important things is actually assuming that something
8:52
fails, have a plan to respond to that. And I think that's where um teams can
8:58
get um a bit better. Um at Nexus, we do have a plan. Um, not to say, you know,
9:04
obviously things could be um, perfect and more battle tested and things and we haven't actually had to really kind of
9:09
put that fully into place, but um, but having a plan and knowing who's responsible for what um, like as an
9:17
example, Nexus has an emergency pause function that um, a few members um, of
9:22
the the team can can hit um, if there's deemed to be a um, an exploit or a
9:28
pending exploit or something like that. So um there are um there are things that
9:34
um teams can do. Um I guess personally I think the I think the general approach
9:41
of teams has improved over time but um I would say that the earlier DeFi teams I
9:46
felt were better at this better at thinking about this. The tooling is a lot better now. So things are a lot more
9:52
I'd say they're a lot more secure but perhaps the approach um or the focus on this has on average has decreased over
9:58
time. Um because I think the earlier teams were much more um focused on um
10:04
like the threat act actors and the the really kind of hostile environment that you're deploying into given that it's
10:10
fully open um and decentralized and anyone can hit any button. Um so yeah um
10:16
I don't think there's any like specific answers here. It's just kind of a combination of a whole bunch of things
10:22
that will that will improve things. But I like the where the um where the question is coming from as in if you put
10:28
yourself in that mode like something will fail what what what do we do in that scenario and how do we um what and
10:34
what are the fail safes etc we are put in place so yeah good question
10:41
thanks Moss for the good question Peter leads us back into the overlap between
Bridging TradFi and onchain insurance (Peter)
10:49
DeFi especially when it comes to insurance and real world asset
10:54
integration. Peter asks, "What are the challenges and opportunities in bridging threadfi and
11:02
onchain insurance?" Yeah. So, I think some addressed some of
11:07
these questions before, but um but from a slightly different angle perhaps. So, I guess the the opportunities here are
11:15
that there's a whole bunch of assets that aren't like native to a blockchain that you can put on a blockchain and
11:21
make tradable um across the the globe. And I think that that is just generally a really big opportunity. Um there's
11:29
huge markets I don't know the numbers but like you know the US treasuries market or um the real estate markets
11:34
like the there huge asset classes that um that could be brought on chain and things would be um a lot more efficient
11:41
and tradable etc and you'd find deeper liquidity pools. So I I do think there's a big opportunity there. The challenges
11:49
really stem from the best solution in terms of custody and legal to make it
11:54
work properly and get the strength behind there so that the token holders actually have recourse um and how that
12:00
kind of works. And then I guess a secondary challenge which is kind of all wrapped up there is going to be around
12:06
the regulation and how that um works and is it allowed and in what jurisdictions and that type of thing and and how how
12:12
do you how do you do that? Um do you block people from certain jurisdictions where it doesn't work etc. So I think
12:18
those are the kind of key um challenges and opportunities. Um I guess yeah
12:24
moving into the next one. So what types of real world assets most likely be tokenized first and why? I think one of
Which real-word assets will be tokenized first (Peter)
12:31
the the biggest one happening at the moment and it still needs to grow and scale is like treasuries. I think stable
12:38
coins has been very successful use case um within blockchain being able to pay
12:44
people globally really quickly and efficiently. I think it's um I get annoyed whenever I go back to the
12:50
banking system to transfer an international um international funds. It's just ridiculous compared to how
12:56
easy it is with the USDC or USDT. Um so I think that is that there's huge
13:03
product market fit there. And the next most obvious use case there is going to be tokenized treasuries where um you can
13:10
earn um you know three, four, 5% or whatever on your on your um savings etc.
13:16
And at the moment there's a lot of legal and regulatory type challenges around that stuff and but it has started. I
13:22
just think it's going to be um gain um a whole lot of scale and then you've got a
13:27
whole bunch of things like ETFs um real estate um etc. And so I think ETFs are
13:33
going to be um probably the next wave and um and there's you know big big
13:39
investment banks like um JP Morgan etc that are kind of looking at this type of stuff and so um I think that's going to
13:45
be kind of the next wave. So three question three why do
Is Bitcoin really decentralized? (Peter)
13:51
people say that Bitcoin is decentralized given the crypto exchanges? So I don't think the exchanges um I don't think
13:58
they're really that reliant on the exchanges. I mean, well, the exchanges is where you do most of your trading
14:04
because Bitcoin isn't really programmable. Um, and so you can't actually build a smart contract or
14:09
whatever and trade fully decentralized. You have to go to a centralized exchange to trade. Um, and so, but that that
14:17
doesn't to me that doesn't mean that Bitcoin isn't necessarily decentralized. Um, it's got quite a few, you know,
14:23
miners, etc. And you can argue what's more decentralized. Is it decentralized enough? It's definitely a spectrum, but
14:29
um but I think it it's I think Bitcoin is still decentralized and doesn't actually um rely on the the the
14:37
exchanges where a lot of the activity happens from a trading point of view and a lot of the funds are actually held does not mean that the underlying
14:43
network and the and the miners etc. who are effectively the ones that decide on
14:48
is there an upgrade or a fork or changes like that. Um that doesn't mean that they're not decentralized. So, um I
14:55
don't think that the fact that crypto exchanges have lots of um Bitcoin and
15:00
trade a lot means that Bitcoin isn't decentralized. Thanks, Peter, for the
15:06
questions. Moving on to Jonah's questions. We're still hovering around
15:12
the infrastructural side of things and Jonah focuses on bridges and asks about
15:19
bridge risks which is a unique risk profile. One question
15:25
is yeah why are bridges considered more risky than other DAPs?
Why are bridges more risky than dApps? (Jonah)
15:32
Yeah. So I think this is a bridges at the moment generally rely on a multi-IG
15:39
underneath um which is you know maybe three or five or something like that and depends on the particular bridge where
15:46
um you've got all this this tech that allows the bridging but ultimately the assets have to be controlled by
15:51
something to decide whether they come in or out. Um and therefore there's a either a consortium or a multisig um
15:59
there of three or five people and that's ultimately what the the risk profile is.
16:04
Um and so those types of multiigs have been targeted specifically because
16:10
they're a big honeypot. Um if you get control of the multisig essentially you can take all the money in the bridge. um
16:15
and the bridges get lots of money in them and so they're definitely a big target um but from threat actors um you
16:21
know in particular in North Korea um and and so I think that's been one of the
16:27
reasons the other reason is that bridges are newer relative to smart contracts um
16:33
systems in general and so therefore the the um the attack vectors and the stuff
16:38
are still kind of being tested or battle tested in real time and so I think just
16:43
in general bridge risk has decreased because people have got um a bit more understanding about where the risks
16:49
really are etc. and so things have been more battle tested. So I think the bridge the bridge risk is decreasing um
16:55
but I still think it's relatively high compared to to other types of apps. Um I guess switching gears a
17:03
little bit the second question um is basically how anonymous do we want DeFi to be and are there concerns about
17:09
metadata which can be extracted from transactions? Um yeah, so I mean DeFi at
17:14
the moment is sued anonymous basically. Um you can
How anonymous should DeFi be? (Jonah)
17:20
it's not tagged who is what, but generally people can work it out if they've got enough tracking software to
17:26
track the on and off ramps. And because then all the transactions are effectively public, then it's effectively um it's not really anonymous
17:35
at all. Um so I guess there's two kind of angles to this. Um there are a whole bunch of people uh
17:41
in the world that would prefer every um financial transaction to be public and be able to track everything and
17:47
everyone. Um and so if you want um that you can effectively do that right now by
17:54
connecting a few dots pieces pieces of information. Um and so then there's the
17:59
other side of um oh we want privacy to you know be a human right and um can we
18:04
um and everyone should be able to do that. Um and so and then then there's
18:10
other concerns about money laundering and funding terrorism and all that type of stuff. So I'm not necessarily going to take a view on one way or another. I
18:18
generally like have some level of privacy but I do acknowledge the the other concerns. Um so if we're talking
18:25
about um concerns about the metadata which can be extracted from transactions I mean I I effectively think DeFi now is
18:31
basically fully um open as in everyone can be doxed if they um if enough effort
18:38
is put in um and so it's kind of fully public at the moment. So that to me that you know there is concerns from privacy.
18:43
If we're talking about how do we get to a fully private DeFi situation, then
18:50
essentially you're going to be either layering zero knowledge proofs on there somewhere or you have like a
18:56
um a kind of layer 2 which is kind of a fully private maybe permissioned to
19:02
start with um blockchain where only certain people that have been approved KYC etc um can use the system and then
19:10
you have a private transactions um involved in in that and and it's fully private and so definitely there are some
19:15
institutions that would um prefer that. So privacy is a I think a very big and
19:21
tricky topic that blockchains are going to have to solve over the over the coming um years and it's probably more
19:27
like a 5 to 10 year type problem um than one to two years. So we're going the technology is going to be there in in
19:34
the next few years to effectively allow fully private stuff but the question is is that politically acceptable and and
19:41
all that type of stuff. So, um, good question.
19:47
Thanks, Jonah. Risk and privacy aside, adoption is is its own beast? Jeremiah is
DeFi adoption thoughts (Jeremiah)
19:56
asking, will adoption be driven by individuals self onboarding or through
20:02
familiar interfaces like banks? Yeah, good question, Jeremiah.
20:09
um don't don't really know obviously but my gut feeling is adoption is going to
20:15
come through two things. One the kind of DeFi mullet type view where um basically
20:22
individuals go through the banks and then the DeFi infrastructure is used on the back end um and that but they just
20:28
look like normal interfaces that they're used to. I think it's very hard to change the the kind of mass majorities
20:35
way that they use technology. That takes a long time and I and I think um they're more likely to go through through like
20:42
banks. So I think it's more likely that banks or neo banks at the moment effectively replace their infrastructure
20:48
with blockchain tech in the back end and then they provide a similar experience from a user point of view um to the to
20:55
their users. So I think that's what that's one angle. I think the other angle which is a definitely quite a bit
21:01
of an unknown and but um has a lot of potential is AI agents um and I think
21:09
it's entirely possible that instead of interacting um with the blockchain directly your AI agent interacts with
21:16
the blockchain on your behalf and does what um it needs to do. So blockchain's very well set up for AI because AI can
21:22
actually execute um transactions on your behalf. um obviously if you set the permissions and all that type of stuff
21:28
up properly, but I think that's a potentially very interesting thing where AI can't really execute in the trad
21:36
space, but it can execute in the blockchain um space. So um who knows where AI goes exactly and how we kind of
21:42
incorporate it in our day-to-day lives, but I think that um you know in the medium term could be a very big um
21:48
change that that happens. I have to wait and see obviously.
21:54
Thank you Jeremiah. Next question is from Droger bringing up a bigger issue maybe the
Making DeFi more user-friendly without sacrificing decentralization (Droege)
22:02
steep learning curve. How do we make DeFi usable without using without losing
22:08
its core principles?
22:14
Yeah. Um this is definitely challenging one. Um, I think one of the one of the
22:21
just general highlevel problems here is that it in some ways decentralization is
22:28
kind of like insurance um in a weird way. It's like it provides you more resiliency. It's so it's protecting
22:34
against that kind of extreme type scenario where you've got a um state level actor or someone very um wellunded
22:42
comes and attacks the chain or or something like that and it it only really matters in those types of extreme
22:48
scenarios. And it's kind of like insurance in um case. You don't you only need it when the worst happens, right?
22:54
And so do people want to pay for insurance? A whole bunch yes but a whole bunch of no. um as well um and like in
23:02
some of it it it depends um so you know I think it's an interesting question um
23:10
at the moment I can definitely see a lot of teams and um etc sacrificing levels
23:16
of decentralization to get adoption whereas the early projects were definitely really really focused on you
23:21
know this only works if we can fully decentralize it and I think there's only very few pro projects that are kind of
23:26
at that kind of I guess more pure um extreme end of the of the spectrum.
23:32
Now, is that a bad thing? Well, I I I kind of think that you have to move some
23:38
way if I think it's very hard to do everything fully fully decentralized. I think it cuts down the scope of what
23:44
products um and users you can attract. And so, I think ultimately we need
23:49
products and users of the tech. Um, and I think it makes sense to have an
23:55
underlying blockchain that is fully decentralized that can essentially be the settlement layer. Um, and but then
24:01
you can choose depending on what app or what purpose you're doing, what level of decentralization makes the most sense.
24:07
Like if it's kind of bringing that back to the the Treadfire questions about like linking like real world assets and
24:13
those types of things, ultimately you can't really um link real world assets in a fully decentralized way. doesn't
24:19
make it doesn't um actually make sense because there is some centralized or legal entity behind this thing. So um I
24:28
think that it's it's I think it's very um difficult to do that but um I think
24:34
the sorry um sorry um yeah so I think it's very
24:41
difficult to to maintain full decentralization
24:46
um and get an a large number of apps or um projects. So, um, yeah, I think that
24:54
one that one's definitely quite challenging to do and it's definitely a trade-off and I think there's a certain amount of pragmatism that has to come
24:59
into this. Thanks you. I also wanted to um highlight one section of DA's
25:06
question because I thought it was quite interesting and I was just writing to Hugh privately to say that I will read
25:11
part of the uh question out loud because um it's hard to you know read it when you're answering it at the same time. I
25:18
I think it's quite interesting. Part of the reason that the internet finally gained ground was due to a common set of
25:24
protocols that all agreed to adhere to. Um I I wanted to get your thoughts on
25:30
this as well. We talk a lot about UX and you know various different kinds of
25:35
standards that make it easy for people to um better understand DeFi and maybe
25:41
accelerate adoption. So yeah, it I don't know. I I I I think it would be great if
25:47
we had like UX standards or you know any other interoperability standards. I I just wanted to get your thoughts on this
25:54
common uh set of protocols idea for DeFi specifically and whether they already
26:00
exist and yeah I I think they do already exist in certain places that make a lot
26:06
of sense like for example tokens. There's a there's token standards and everyone can integrate any token because
26:11
all the tokens are on the same standard or close enough. Um, and so I think that's like a very clear one that makes
26:17
a lot of sense and it it's one of the reasons DeFi is growing is because you have those common standards. Um I guess
26:24
the the other thing is like that I see happening are kind of intents which is kind of like um sign a it's basically
26:32
sign a message to say I want to trade a minimum of I want to trade one token for
26:38
a minimum of five other tokens or something and then someone else comes along and fills it and it doesn't care where they where they fill it from. They
26:45
come they come from um they they can work that out and it could be on chain A, it could be on chain B or whatever.
26:50
And so that I think um ultimately we have the EVM is a pretty solid standard
26:57
that's permeated throughout the industry quite a lot. Um we have token standards and we have these kind of also intents
27:04
are kind of getting there. So um I do think at a technical level there is a definitely standards that have increased
27:11
adoption. Can there be more consistency and stuff? Yes, of course. Um, but I I
27:17
do think that this is kind of key in making it happen. Um, I also would say
27:24
that with the AI potential happening that the standards may matter a bit less
27:31
than they did before um because the AI can interpret the differences and know
27:37
um and so there's it can create a standard at a higher level which is so
27:42
that's again an unknown not sure where it's going to go but um but in general I agree with your the thrust of the the
27:48
comment because um the a lot of The success that DeFi has had as has been because of underlying standards that
27:54
have some provided consistency and mean meant that protocol A can integrate integrate with protocols B and and
28:01
protocol C can build on top of both of them and and create a new product and that composability aspect makes sense.
28:07
So yeah, thank you Drogo. Moving on with Lavi's
Keeping users motivated to stay decentralized (Lavi)
28:14
questions. Lavi is mainly interested in keeping people and users ideologically
28:20
invested in decentralization and I think they're quite interesting. So first question,
28:27
how can decentralized systems keep people motivated to stay decentralized?
28:34
Yeah, and this is kind of the insurance question. So you kind of using fully decentralized systems often involves
28:40
some trade-off. either it's a bit more expensive to use, a bit more of a hassle to use for or whatever it is. There's
28:46
some type of trade-off versus a centralized one which is like fast and quick and all the rest of it, right? Um
28:51
and so it's kind of like, okay, I would pay a bit more for security, but people don't people find it hard to evaluate
28:59
that. Um and so um like should I like should I really pay more? I don't really care. I don't really understand, etc.
29:06
And so I I actually think this is I think this is a very important topic because I I want more people to be
29:12
motivated to stay decentralized. I guess the pragmatist in me is um is a bit
29:17
perhaps a bit jaded now from this that I think a lot of people just don't care. Um and should we have rules? I I don't
29:24
think rules are going to help. I think people will just um just it's a free market. people will do what they want to
29:31
do and make the trade-offs that they want and and unfortunately like people
29:36
will probably use the less decentralized stuff and then something will go wrong, you know, not very frequently perhaps,
29:42
but um they it's at some point they'll go it will go wrong and blow up um because it isn't decentralized and then
29:48
they'll suffer losses and then what'll likely happen is they'll go to the um
29:53
regulators or they'll go to the courts and they'll sue people and and and then you know maybe after that they'll some
29:59
more regulatory rules come in place because that's generally how things tend to work. Um and and so then maybe um
30:06
those rules go too far and they impact everything or maybe they they're perfectly balanced and they say well hold on it was this risk um it wasn't
30:14
decentralized enough so we'll target that and make it harder for those types of projects and then give a boost to the
30:19
more decentralized projects. I don't know that that's kind of a long time frame, you know, 10 year type thing. Um,
30:26
and but how do we fix things in the meantime? I I honestly don't have any um
30:32
silver bullets on this one. I think it's a very hard problem and it comes back to basically people want stuff that's fast
30:37
and cheap and easy to use and um it's often easier to build that in a less decentralized way. Hopefully the people
30:45
putting the effort in and building it in a fully decentralized way can make it so that the um you don't trade off the UX
30:52
versus the decentralization or the cost. And as long as that can be closer then hopefully the the decentralized projects
30:58
will um will win. Um so good question. Don't have any solid answers on it. I
31:04
think it's a really tricky one. Um and I I don't think rules should be put in place in general um for this one. So, so
Decentralized vs centralized networks sharing benefits (Lavi)
31:13
yeah, I guess on the on the on your last point, which I don't think I addressed
31:18
fully, how decentralized network share benefits better than centralized ones, even they're less efficient. Um, I don't
31:26
I don't think those things necessarily um equate as in I think the benefits can
31:33
be shared if they're decentralized or centralized. It just depends on the structure. Decentralized networks tend
31:38
to um tend to have this philosophy behind them that they share the benefits with the users more but it doesn't mean
31:45
they couldn't be implemented in a different way. Um so I think the the
31:50
decentralized networks generally require people to participate to make it work where it can't be coded fully. Um and so
31:58
the fact that they do that they will usually pay a benefit to the people that provide that work to the system. Um and
32:05
so in that way they generally share benefits better. Um but it doesn't mean that you couldn't set up a centralized
32:10
entity like that as well. So um so yeah hopefully that answers your questions. I
32:16
don't really have any solid answers on this one to be honest. I think it's a very tricky problem. Thanks you. I just wanted to uh mention
32:24
here that we have a reading group on governance and while we cannot directly
32:30
still respond to questions like these I think um one good way to start thinking
32:36
about these problems is maybe think about how cooperatives may be better structured for today's technologies and
32:43
you know also on Ethereum if you were to have cooperatives how would they look like and what would we need uh So yeah,
32:52
I I really enjoyed Lav's questions and I wanted I I just wanted to encourage him uh or you know others to join the
33:00
reading group if they're interested in diving deep. Okay, moving on to crypto
33:06
accountants questions and I I'd like to suggest that this is the last uh
33:12
question set we cover. We have three or four more that we can cover in the in the next episode of the DI AMA if that's
33:20
okay with you. you. We're almost um at time. So, crypto accountant asks, "How
33:28
might DeFi reshape auditing processes given the transparency of blockchain
33:35
transactions?" Yeah. So, um I
DeFi resharping auditing processes (CryptoAccountant)
33:41
guess a lot very shortly. Um, I think this is one of the areas where it makes
33:47
a massive difference like um like it's so it's so much easier to just set up a
33:53
whole um automated auditing process that you can just track down the transactions
33:58
etc. And like it it's fully open. You don't have to the auditors don't have to worry if they've got all the information
34:05
or not. Um obviously there's stuff that's onchain and offchain. You have to do the offchain stuff a bit differently,
34:10
but for the onchain stuff you can just make sure that you've got everything just by getting the addresses. And then once you've got that, you can audit
34:16
everything and it can be automated even and I know a whole bunch of tax software especially for individuals um but also
34:22
increasingly for companies there are systems in place that basically just pull all the transactions in categorize
34:28
them and um give the whole um do all the accounting and you've got the auditing already in in place. Um, and so it can
34:36
really be automated um, a lot more than stuff could be before um, when you're kind of pulling stuff from different
34:42
systems and making sure that things add up and and all the rest of it. So um, I think it can do a lot on on that side of
34:49
things. Um on the on the educational stuff um I
Blockchain and DeFi in university curriculums (CryptoAccountant)
34:56
I mean definitely I think um universities and um different courses
35:01
should integrate um should add units or you know consider this in in their um in
35:07
their curriculums. I I think that this is already happening um in
35:12
various places there are specific courses. Um I know um our chief legal officer, she's attending a blockchain
35:18
and law specific um course at at the moment. Um and is relatively new. I
35:24
think they're running their first or second um cohort. So um a lot of this stuff is starting to happen now.
35:30
Obviously, it takes a while for it to become established and for people to understand all the details and stuff, but um but I I think it's definitely
35:37
happening and and more and more units are coming out um based based on this, especially in the computer science
35:43
areas, but also in in more I guess more generalist um you know um courses or
35:50
classes. So, it's definitely happening at the moment and um and you see people I see people applying for jobs that have
35:57
attended these types of courses and stuff already. So hopefully it will continue to happen um even more.
36:04
Thank you crypto accountant. I'm personally also looking forward to more blockchain and governance classes at
36:11
universities. Okay. Uh thank you Hugh. We have three or four more questions
36:17
which I think we can cover with brave new DeFi on the next episode of the DeFi AMA. Thanks again for your time and for
36:25
your insightful answers to these questions and thanks everybody for posting your questions. This is how we
36:33
uh learn together and I think and I think it's a lot of fun. You any last words before we close the call today?
36:41
No. Hopefully you found my answers useful. Obviously I don't have all the answers here. Um these are just my particular views on on things. But um
36:49
yeah, keep the questions coming and and hopefully you find these answers useful as you as you learn more about um DeFi.
36:57
All right, thank you Hugh. Stay safe in D5 everybody. Talk thanks everyone. Bye.
