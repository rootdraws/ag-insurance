all right so every six months we share
0:02
an updated road map that outlines the
0:04
foundation and DOW team's high level
0:05
objectives and each team's priorities
0:08
that help the mutual meet those
0:09
objectives looking at our core
0:11
objectives here the core objectives
0:12
largely remain the same as the previous
0:15
six-month road map growth is still the
0:17
top priority for all teams and our Focus
0:19
will be on growing cover sales in the
0:20
next six months now that stage one of
0:22
the tokenomics upgrade is complete we'll
0:24
be focused on growing and building our
0:26
community so we can scale the Dow and
0:27
work with more members looking to help
0:29
us realize the highle objectives while
0:32
stage one of the tokenomics has been
0:33
implemented the R&D and Engineering
0:36
teams will need to conduct research to
0:37
finalize stage two of the tokenomics
0:39
revamp which is focused on how the
0:41
mutual manage capitalization levels when
0:43
the capital pool approaches the cover
0:45
driven minimum Capital requirement
0:47
limits and Progressive decentral uh
0:50
decentralization is the final high level
0:53
objective as we grow our community
0:55
evaluate how more members can get active
0:56
within the Dow and how we can update
0:58
governance to allow more people and
0:59
specialist to get involved we can
1:01
continue down the path of
1:04
decentralization now let's look at each
1:06
team that will be supporting these
1:08
objectives and we'll start on the next
1:09
slide with the engineering team and
1:11
their priorities for the next six
1:13
months so to help us drive growth the
1:15
engineering team will be updating the
1:17
cover by UI to improve the user
1:19
experience in q1 as well as implementing
1:22
the cover edits features so people can
1:23
simply edit their existing cover nft to
1:25
renew or increase their coverage instead
1:28
of needing to buy a whole new cover
1:30
nft these features will help reduce
1:32
friction and should contribute to higher
1:34
renewal rates and cover buys over time
1:37
in addition the engineers are going to
1:38
work to optimize the cover router and
1:40
pursue gas optimizations throughout the
1:43
different functions within the protocol
1:44
to help reduce gas cost for members when
1:47
they are participating within the mutual
1:49
the engineers are also going to launch a
1:50
notification framework that will allow
1:52
members to subscribe the notifications
1:54
or when they join as members to know
1:57
when their kyc is complete to get
2:00
updates when their cover is close to
2:01
expiring or when their staking pool
2:03
deposit is close to expiring and and
2:05
other things like that you know when uh
2:07
a governance proposal is coming up for
2:09
vote that they want to get notifications
2:11
about that notification service will
2:13
help people stay engaged and stay
2:15
updated as well the engineers are also
2:17
going to work on completing the
2:19
technical work required to close the
2:20
cover reinvestment and retr session
2:22
agreement and this will significantly
2:24
increase premiums flowing into the
2:25
capital pool they'll also work to
2:27
support the addition of new cover
2:29
products and work with the investment
2:30
committee if new proposals to invest the
2:32
capital pool float are pursued the
2:35
engineering team has a pretty full
2:36
agenda for the next six months but over
2:38
the last six months the engineers were
2:40
able to develop audit and implement the
2:42
toomics in uh upgrade after members
2:44
approved nmp 209 are an onchain vote
2:48
that was the top priority over the last
2:49
six months and I think everyone's very
2:51
happy to see that implemented they also
2:53
improved the mutual security measures
2:55
and we'll continue to do so over the
2:56
next six months I'll move on to the next
2:58
slide and talk about the BD teams
3:00
priorities for the next six
3:03
months so the BD team will work with
3:05
staking pool managers to develop and
3:07
launch new cover products there are
3:08
currently cover products in development
3:10
that would allow the mutual to expand
3:12
into new market segments and grow cover
3:14
sales and premiums this also includes
3:16
working with the engineering team to
3:18
develop an MVP for new eth slashing
3:21
covered products to further expand into
3:23
that market segment the bidy team will
3:26
also be conducting Research into
3:28
traditional risk markets to evaluate
3:29
other deal structures similar to the
3:31
cover red deal so the mutual can use
3:33
onchain Capital to underwrite offchain
3:35
risks and grow cover sales and premiums
3:38
and of course the BD team will continue
3:39
to work in support existing St pool
3:41
managers within the Nexus Mutual
3:43
ecosystem to help managers scale and
3:45
still more cover through work with
3:47
managers like Sherlock Uno and E and
3:49
Distributors such as open cover the
3:51
mutual can create more open capacity and
3:53
reach new users on l2s or gas costs are
3:56
accessible for more retail users and
3:59
last six months the BD team secured the
4:01
cover redeal closed a retail Mutual deal
4:03
on onboarded new staking pool managers
4:06
and scaled existing Partnerships with
4:08
teams like liquid Collective we've seen
4:10
protocol cover sales decline in 2023 due
4:12
to low yields but as we see yields
4:15
picking back up um we're seeing more
4:17
inbound in a greater focus on new
4:19
listings to keep an eye out for new
4:21
protocol cover listings and our listing
4:23
spotlights on Twitter moving to the next
4:26
slide I'll talk a bit about the
4:28
foundation legal team
4:30
so the legal team has been working to
4:32
finalize arrangements with members who
4:34
have received claim payments from the
4:36
mutual and also received reimbursement
4:38
through either bankruptcy proceedings or
4:40
direct reimbursement per their mandate
4:42
in nmpi 205 this includes pursuing
4:46
reimbursements to the capital pool for
4:48
FDX block by Gemini hold not Oiler and
4:51
any other applicable claims so
4:54
reimbursement is being pursued to ensure
4:56
cover holders can't earn a profit at the
4:58
expense of nxm stakers as developments
5:01
are made on reimbursement will share
5:02
updates but so far the legal team has
5:04
done some incredible work on this end
5:07
legal also plays a major role in the
5:09
covery deal and other deals like it as
5:11
well as in the development process for
5:13
new cover products over the last six
5:15
months the legal team has pursued
5:16
reimbursement established legal
5:17
infrastructure for the foundation and
5:19
evaluated and helped update cover
5:21
wording documents to provide members
5:23
with greater Clarity on what protections
5:24
are included in addition to other
5:27
initiatives on the next slide I'll go
5:29
over the product and risk team
5:32
priorities um just as an FYI the product
5:34
and risk team is jointly managed by
5:36
myself and Hugh um and we're supported
5:38
by the legal team our work over the next
5:41
six months will be in a support capacity
5:43
when it comes to the cover Redal new
5:45
cover product development and new
5:46
listings we'll also support the account
5:49
abstraction research project which will
5:51
involve the engineering and BD teams to
5:53
evaluate how the mutual can use account
5:55
abstraction in the future to improve the
5:57
user experience in the next ACC Mutual
6:00
UI I'll also be working on a membership
6:02
benefits program project to evaluate
6:05
supplementary Services which we can
6:07
offer our members to improve the
6:09
benefits of membership and support
6:10
growth in new members in the last six
6:13
months we've created the claims history
6:15
database worked with legal to create
6:17
cover wording templates and guidelines
6:19
and expanded to managing list the
6:22
listing process for new protocol cover
6:23
listings there's been a significant
6:26
amount of support provided to the new
6:28
cover product development process and
6:31
we've provided support to other teams as
6:32
needed as well moving on to talk about
6:35
the R&D
6:37
team um of course the major
6:39
accomplishment for R&D in the last six
6:40
months has been the management
6:42
communication and the execution of the
6:43
tokenomics upgrade project but over the
6:45
next six months the R&D team will
6:47
continue to work with the engineering
6:49
team on stage two of the tokenomics
6:51
project R&D is also going to create an
6:53
improved process for refreshing the
6:55
cover based MCR calculation parameter on
6:58
a regular basis
7:00
um which will
7:01
include uh accounting for the various
7:03
risks the mutual is now underwriting to
7:05
ensure there's always enough Capital to
7:07
pay all claims I'll also work to support
7:10
the investment committee as well as
7:11
maintain the existing Dune dashboards
7:13
that created um in the last six months
7:15
and in 2023 in the last six months the
7:18
R&D team has created the nxm staking
7:21
Dune dashboard and the rting amm Dune
7:24
dashboard which has been hugely popular
7:27
in the last several months on the next
7:30
slide I'll talk about the community team
7:32
priorities in the next six months our
7:34
core goal is going to be to grow our
7:36
community increase engagement and
7:38
re-engage members who maybe haven't been
7:40
as involved as they were in the past and
7:43
improve awareness about the mutual
7:44
through our social channels we'll be
7:46
updating the da website to include the
7:48
governance Hub which will be a One-Stop
7:50
shop for everything you need to know to
7:51
stay involved and get involved in the
7:54
current governance proposals and votes
7:57
the Sten pool managers Hub which will be
7:59
a central repository for new and
8:01
existing pool managers to track new
8:02
listings staking analytics and for
8:05
guides on how to launch and effectively
8:06
manage the pool will include on the Dow
8:09
website information on the Dow teams
8:11
where we are and executing on our
8:13
priorities um resources about staying
8:16
safe in Defi and more we really want to
8:18
expand the Dow website to be a place
8:20
where members can go um and find all the
8:22
resources they need to stay involved and
8:24
to learn more about becoming active
8:26
within the Dow we're also going to
8:28
launch an interview series on and
8:29
Twitter spaces talk with dii Builders
8:31
about risks in defi what Primitives we
8:33
need to see to power mainstream adoption
8:35
and how people are building on top of
8:37
the Nexus Mutual protocol and an effort
8:39
to create greater awareness and build
8:41
our community I'll also be working to
8:43
get the V2 contracts included on all the
8:46
major portfolio aggregators such as
8:48
xerion dbank zapper and others um this
8:51
will help us improve our discoverability
8:53
and will just be a nice perk for members
8:55
who like to review all of their
8:57
portfolio Holdings um in one place I'm a
9:00
big fan of xerion myself the last six
9:03
months have been quite busy as the
9:05
community team played a pretty important
9:06
role in educating uh people about the
9:09
tokenomics revamp project and
9:10
facilitating discussions on the Forum
9:12
about this as well we've also overhauled
9:14
their Discord server the last six months
9:16
to make it easier to find information
9:17
and stay engaged and we've worked to
9:19
improve communication between the wider
9:21
community and staking pool managers this
9:24
of course is an ongoing process but
9:25
we've seen more capacity requests and
9:27
subsequent cover buys when we've
9:29
connected request for cover with
9:30
managers who are able to open up
9:32
capacity overall it's been an incredibly
9:35
eventful 6 months for all of the
9:36
foundation and DOW teams but we're
9:38
looking at another busy six months I'm
9:41
looking forward to Growing cover sales
9:42
and building our community in q1 and
9:45
Q2
