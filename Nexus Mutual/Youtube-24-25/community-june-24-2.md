DeFi Yields & Risks Overview
1:58
everybody um it's it's been I think it's been about a month since our last Community call it a lot has changed in
2:03
defi since we provided an overview of defi yields and risks um if you
2:11
subscribe to the state of defi yields newsletter that I have you'll notice that I've also been on the Hiatus while
2:16
traveling um kind of hard for me to post on on miror while I'm traveling but I should be getting a report up next week
2:23
um but previously defi yields in the crypto Market at large was in a bit of the slump um everybody was waiting for
2:29
the E ETF announcement uh the last time that we were talking things kind of like
2:34
leveled off uh in in crypto and and defy in a whole yields had gone from these
2:41
like record highs in in the 20 to 30% range down to about the 8 to 12% range
2:48
but since the ETF has been approved there's been more activity on chain um we've seen funding rates go from like
2:55
low single digits back up into the 10 to 20% range which has signal the more um
3:01
some more bullish sentiment in the market but that could also um flip back the other way so while things have
3:06
picked up there's still um you know some hesitation in the market I think people are still waiting for confirmation on on
3:12
some of the ETF news um but by looking at the Benchmark yields on vault FYI we
3:18
can kind of get a feel for you know where yields are heading now um the average yield across the top 15
3:24
opportunities on B FYI sits at uh 32.482947
3:29
the average across the top 15 lending markets is 21.29% apy so we are seeing
3:35
yields starting to Trend back up as opposed to the last time we spoke when lending Market yields were between 8 and
3:41
12% um there's a lot more demand for leverage in the market um there are a lot of people that are still running the
3:48
usde or ssde uh loop where they're leveraging that or people are still farming points and farming yields on uh
3:56
liquid reaking tokens these both of these things have been Big Driver for yields as well um and while yields are
4:03
trending back upwards we're seeing that risk on chain is also going back up um
4:09
whether it's in lending markets or some of these newer protocols on l2s uh we've seen uh you know several hacks here in
4:15
the last month uh the most recent was velor which is a protocol on lanaa L2
4:20
that was hacked for 6.8 million after a fee overflow exploit um you know an
4:26
attack was able to drain uh like I said 6.8 million ion after conducting that exploit SE Finance which is a compound
4:33
V2 Fork was hacked for $20 million after an exchange rate exploit took place um I
4:39
had put out a thread on compound V2 Forks after this and how historically I think they are one of the most exploited
4:45
Forks that are out there so while there's a lot of users that are moving their activity over to l2s like bass
4:51
optimism and arbitrum it's important to note that there are quite a few protocols in l2s that are Forks um and
4:57
forks come with added risk so teams that fork protocols code may not be aware of certain vulnerabilities so it's more
5:03
likely that a loss is going to occur in a fork uh we are working on reviewing some of the more popular Forks on l2s um
5:09
on Bas and optimism uh and arbitrum so that we can uh evaluate those for a listing and if we can get those up we
5:16
can offer more users protection for those popular protocols where people are earning yields um to date we've
5:22
prioritized listings where users have signal demand or where users are depositing a large amount of funds uh
5:29
this strategy has really helped us scale cover sales in Q2 and as defi yields continue to rise you know we'll look for
5:36
those opportunities where we can add Moon listings to benefit members who are buying cover Through the Nexus Mutual UI
5:42
or through Distributors like open cover on l2s uh diving into the growth update for
Q2 Growth Overview
5:48
Q2 uh we've seen some pretty impressive growth in cover sales continue into Q2
5:53
in q1 we saw growth from you know where cover sales were in Q4 2020 3 and we've
6:00
continued to see cover sales rise and premiums are rise pretty substantially
6:05
so so far so far in Q2 the Mutual has sold 98.5 million in cover and earned
6:11
875k in premiums Based on data source from the full list of covers V2 query on
6:17
the Nexus Mutual covers Dune dashboard um I believe that number is higher now uh I updated that I think it was just um
6:24
like late last week I upd those figures so we've seen some pretty large cover bu that came in over the weekend too so
6:30
we're definitely well over a million in cover sold and I would imagine we're over 900k in premiums earned in Q2 but
6:38
based on the numbers that I shared um that represents an increase of about 32%
6:43
in cover sold in 59% in premiums earned compared to q1
6:49
2024 um in q1 we earned uh over 500k in premium and I believe it was in April
6:56
alone that we earned more in premium than we did in the entirety of q1 so
7:01
we've seen a big demand for coverage and because of the way that pricing is
7:06
handled in V2 where Stak and pool managers can set pricing the average um cost of cover that people have been
7:12
paying has gone up which has led to that premium growth as well so since the beginning of the year the Mutual has
7:18
seen a 3X inactive cover compared to Q4 2024 total cover sold has increased by
7:25
about 69% and premiums earned has grown by uh over 3 116% so if you compare the mutual's
7:32
earnings across cover premiums investment returns and Ram value acral the mutual is earning a dollar for every
7:39
$27 in tvl um that means that Nexus Mutual is earning more on a proportional
7:44
basis than a lot of the major lending protocols out there on a monthly basis the mutual is earning more than compound
7:50
and fluid u i put out a thread covering you know some of these growth figures as well on premiums earned and the
7:56
investment returns um on my profile earlier this week uh but the main drivers for growth in Q2 so far have
8:03
been bundle protocol cover and protocol cover those are still the two dominant cover products that we're selling we
8:08
launched bundle protocol cover two weeks before q1 ended and it's been incredibly popular bundle protocol cover has
8:14
contributed more premiums than all of the other products combined in Q2 which is why we've seen such a large increase
8:19
in premiums earned since q1 other important drivers of growth include open
8:24
covers growth in sales so open cover is a Syndicate built on top of the mutual that distributes protocol cover on l2s
8:30
they have been steadily growing their cover sales in Q2 um so far in Q2
8:36
they've sold 3.57 million in cover and they've brought in 31.7k in premiums
8:41
earned um open cover serves to a primarily retail audience on base arment
8:47
optimism um as well as users that don't want to kyc and become members of the mutual but still want to buy cover we've
8:53
also worked with the EFI team on a point of sale integration for the EFI liquid vaults which means that users can buy
8:59
cover directly in the EFI user interface without first becoming a member so by allowing members to buy cover without
9:06
leaving protocols UI we can drive a lot more cover sales based on what we've seen from ether fi already we've sold
9:13
over six million in cover in just two weeks after this integration so look out for more point of sale Integrations in
9:20
the future as we work with other list of protocols to make it easier for users to buy cover without leaving a protocol's
9:27
UI Sherlock has also been increasing their quarter share cover purchases and expanding their product offerings and
9:32
the mutual plans to support their new product offerings going into Q3 look with Collective has also renewed their
9:38
coverage with the mutual and increased the amount of cover they'll be buying on a quarterly basis we're also working on
9:44
some new cover products that we'll be launching here um this quarter and next quarter which we imagine uh or which we
9:51
project will drive cover sales as well so we are seeing material cover growth
9:56
across multiple lines of business with more cover products plann for launch here in Q2 and Q3 as well as new point
10:03
of sale Integrations our goal again is to 10x cover sales by the end of 2024
10:08
and I think we're well on our way so keep an eye out for the Q2 2024 insights report that we'll be publishing in July
10:14
after Q wraps up for a more comprehensive overview of the mutuals growth I also wanted to talk a little
Buy Cover Flow Updates and New Cover Asset
10:21
bit about some of the improvements that we've made in the Nexus Mutual UI for the buy coverflow we talked about this
10:28
last time as well and while the foundation and dat teams are working to increase cover sales in premiums earned
10:34
we're also working on removing friction within the UI and improving the user experience for our members so if you've
10:40
bought cover recently you've noticed changes that we've made to the buy cover page and the Nexus UI um you know
10:45
there's a new look and feel on there as well so it's easier to browse products there are uh categories now so if you're
10:52
primarily buying cover for Lending protocols you can filter and just look at lending protocols on the browse page
10:58
you can filter by those categories um if there's a certain cover product that you find yourself buying on
11:04
a regular basis like if you're somebody that's coming back and buying Pendle cover or cover for spark protocol you
11:10
can set that as a favorite so that it'll show up at the top of the page for browse covers so you can quickly find
11:16
those covered products that you're you know using on a regular basis um and then if you select a product and you go
11:21
to buy cover you'll notice that we've improved the ux here as well and we've added some new features like I said
11:27
we've added that favorites feature um which has been beneficial and I know there's been more than a few members
11:32
that have reached out about that and so that they really enjoy that uh after the recent governance proposal we've also
11:37
added usdc as an option for um covers so if you want to buy a cover that's
11:43
denominated in usdc as is the payout asset you can now do that in the UI um
11:49
if you want to pay in usdc and receive a claim payout in usdc if you suffer a loss you can select that right on the
11:54
buy cover page for a given product um I'll cover that proposal once once I get
11:59
over to the governance section of the call as well and then the other nice thing is you can clearly see how much
12:05
total capacity is available in eth die or usdc terms depending on what asset you select so you know how much capacity
12:12
is available across all of the staking pools so while we're working to grow cover sales the Foundation Engineering
12:18
team is working on overhauling other sections of the Nexus muui to improve the user experience for people buying
12:24
cover people staking nxm and managing staking pools assessing claims and filing claims and more so we'll have
12:31
more updates on that progress over the summer but I will hand things over to Hugh to give an update on the cover R
12:38
deal H yeah thanks bra everyone um yeah so
Cover Re Update
12:43
pretty exciting we um it took us took us a long time have to have to admit but um we finally executed on the the covery
12:50
deal um well the stage one um phase one of the the covery deal so um basically
12:56
um we're in covery is a reinsurance company out of Bermuda um they reinsure
13:02
um a whole bunch of different um insurance companies mainly in the states um and different portfolios of business
13:09
um like more regular real world Insurance portfolios so um motor and home and liability coverage and a whole
13:15
bunch of different things um and we uh the first stage of the deal is where Nexus is going to kind invest um we have
13:23
invested um into their um into their tokenized offering um so they um and
13:32
basically will'll earn a return on on that so we we have deposited some e into a um taken a loan um for some of the
13:40
investment and used some of the um the die in The Stables in the in the pool to
13:45
make up the rest and we transferred over um 12 million um in Stables over to to
13:51
the fund so um that's been technically executed and we've got the um also signed all the legal agreements to um to
13:57
back that up so um that's a that's a pretty um big step cuz one of the things here is like it's a way it's effectively
14:03
a way for nexuses on chain Capital to um to back some real world um coverage so
14:10
so that's pretty interesting um and we're expecting to the yields um definitely variable because it depends
14:15
on the claims experience of the portfolios um but it's some expected somewhere in the range of 18 to low 20%
14:21
um which is pretty strong um so I think the um the other phase of the deal which
14:27
is going to be which we're working on um at the moment with with covery um is where they will um then transfer um a
14:35
chunk of the risk that they're writing into Nexus um and so that requires um
14:41
the Cayman um Regulators um approval to to do that so the first step is um to um
14:47
start that formal approval process we've already spoken to them um and initial indications have been positive but um we
14:53
have to go through the process there so um so that's that's a pretty big step um it's um there's always
14:59
um I guess quirks along the way as you interact with the real world a bit more but um but I think um it's a pretty big
15:06
achievement to getting um some some Capital um earning more yield in the in the in for the pool um and and secondly
15:13
backing some on train risk so yeah pretty excited to to have that um live right
15:19
now um should I give a bit more of a broader update on on Foundation things
Updates From The Foundation
15:24
as well yeah that'd be great yeah cool so I think there's quite a lot of stuff going
15:30
on I think um as you seen the the UI enhancements have been going going out with um with the cover flows and bunch
15:37
of the other cover bunch of the other flows are being worked on right now um so I particularly like the the new sty
15:43
and it's really smooth so um looking forward to that happening on the staking side as well um where which is where I
15:49
spent a took my time um but yeah I think um um that's that's going well um within
15:55
the team there's I think Brave mentioned we have um this this
16:00
goal of getting like 10x cover growth by the end of the year end of 2024 and there's kind of three main pillars to
16:06
that um the first one is looking at like point of sale Integrations and um and
16:12
ways for people to basically buy cover more easily um and we and we launched an integration with um with eii where you
16:19
can buy cover for their um liquid volts um directly within the UI so just the one click add-on which is pretty cool um
16:26
and so we're looking to kind of um expand that um into into other projects within the
16:31
ecosystem rather than just having a link where they can come to the NEX site to do it they can actually execute the the
16:37
cover by um within the partner um UI so that that would be um great so we're looking to roll that out so that's kind
16:42
of like one um one stream of things so um like point of sale or embedded cover type options um the second stream of
16:49
things is what we're call like tailored or bespoke deals um we get a lot of requests from different people um
16:55
wanting um either large covers um trying to help Source capacity for them or for
17:01
tailored um products whether it's slashing or something slightly different um and so they we're we're seeing a lot
17:08
of demand there and it's definitely increased over the past several months and we've got quite a few deals in the pipeline there that um you know
17:14
hopefully they'll start executing over the coming months take a little bit longer to get live but um but there's we
17:19
think there's significant growth in that um side of things as well so that's kind of the the second stream and the third
17:25
stream which um which Le is going to talk a bit more about but is um is looking to expand the number of
17:32
syndicates or people building on top of the mutual um and you know that's probably um a bit longer term um growth
17:39
trajectory but um still very very meaningful and open cover is a really good example there where they're selling
17:44
covers on l2s um and probably selling um haven't looked at the numbers very
17:49
recently but you know probably half the covers that we that we sell um in terms of number of covers a Sol by open cover
17:55
um so you know I think um that that type of thing and just expanding out the distribution um with multiple syndicates
18:01
or um groups um building on top of us is is going to be really powerful so those are the three main um strategies uh
18:09
three main um goto Market strategies that we're looking to execute on to um hit the the 10 times cover growth so
18:16
pretty much all focused on growth um and scaling up we've got the platform in the right spot um and obviously there's
18:22
wider um growth and interest within Defi and crypto more generally so very much looking to to capitalize on that over
18:29
over the coming several years or however along this last so um so yeah that's um that's a big Focus from the from the
18:36
foundation side I'll back over you
Grants & Accelerator Program
18:42
Lee all right thanks you yeah I we you know we're making a lot of progress on the growth side
18:49
there's a lot that's in the works um one of the initiatives that we started is the grants and accelerator program so
18:55
this is a dow initiative that I'm working on with Dopey um we put up a proposal on the Forum uh
19:02
sometime in April and you know we went through the the governance process this was put up to a snapshat vote and then
19:09
in may members voted to approve the Nexus Mutual grants accelerator program which is a $3 million initiative to fund
19:15
oneoff projects and emerging risk businesses with the capital they need to build on top of Nexus Mutual but this is
19:22
part of our strategy to grow cover sales by 10x in 2024 and uh 202 ex here over the next
19:30
couple of years um this program is going to be managed by a committee uh it's a
19:35
five- member team that's led by Dopey who serves as the committee chair the other committee members are myself um
19:42
roxs who is the head of engineering on the foundation team Hugh and then Ray
19:48
who is the head of R&D uh the committee has the discretion to award individual grants of up to 100,000 and accept teams
19:54
in the accelerator program and provide funding of up to 500,000 000 per team um
20:00
if you look on the Nexus Mutual Dow website you can see the grants page and
20:06
the accelerator page um currently the bounties offered for accelerators are
20:12
250,000 for a team um that goes to the application process and gets accepted um
20:17
you could also see rfps for the different grants but on the grant side there is a million dollars dedicated to
20:23
Grants over the next 18 months the goal of the grants program is to drive growth within the M uh the Nexus Mutual
20:29
ecosystem so by funding individuals and teams with the expertise necessary to conduct in-depth research build out
20:35
archical infrastructure for new syndicates and Distributors um teams
20:40
that can improve the user experience and simplify the integration process the mutual can onboard more risk experts
20:46
into our ecosystem and reduce friction for people looking to buy cover and protect their assets ultimately the
20:52
improvements outlined in the rfps um and any outside Grant ideas
20:57
should contribute to material growth in cover sales um again this is on the
21:03
Nexus Mutual Dow page you can see the grants page um we have the existing request for proposals that are on that
21:10
page on on the Dow websites um and also you know we're open to accepting applications for teams that have ideas
21:17
outside of the rfps U but that main driver and our main priorities are focused on growth you can learn more
21:24
about our priorities and what we're looking for on that grants page on the Dow website
21:29
for the accelerator program there's $2 million dedicated to this program over the next 18 months uh the goal of this
21:36
program is to create new startups and support existing syndicates that are building on top of Nexus so that we can
21:43
enhance our ecosystem we're particularly interested in new lines of business or businesses that create new cover
21:49
products that can distribute coverage facilitate underwriting or enhanced risk management for the Nexus Mutual
21:55
ecosystem uh participants in this program could include agents Brokers Underwriters claim adjusters data
22:02
analysts working on risk modeling data providers protocols that want to natively include coverage or protocols
22:08
that are expanding on the mutuals core functionality um the accelerator program is going to work a lot like a
22:14
traditional accelerator where we accept people into our startup program we incubate them for uh you know several
22:22
months and then work very closely with them over the next year so uh funding
22:27
through this program is is awarded on on a milestone basis um so yeah if you have an idea for a risk business that you
22:34
want to build on top of the mutual or if you're looking to more widely distribute cover um you should check out the
22:40
accelerator page on the Nexus Mutual da website as well you can get there right from the homepage of the Dow website but
22:46
all of the information about that and some ideas for exelor we're looking for are outlined on that page um so I'm
22:53
going to be spending quite a bit of time on this and so is Dopey um you know we're going to just doing a lot of
22:58
Outreach and looking for people that can complete some of our grants and looking for teams that are um skilled risk
23:05
experts or teams with different expertise that can start building on the mutual um I think the accelerator
23:11
program is a really great way to get more people building on top so that we can get more businesses like open cover
23:18
that are helping distribute coverage and then expanding our product offerings um on the governance and
Governance Updates
23:25
investment committee update side um there's been quite a bit happening on the governance side there's been a lot
23:30
of activity on the governance forum and I'm expecting more posts to come out uh in the next couple of weeks as well so
23:37
I'll just run through a brief overview of governance activity to date highlight some upcoming proposals and then share
23:42
an update from the investment committee the most recent proposal that went up for vote was nmpi 223 which is adding
23:49
usdc as an asset within the capital pool um this was up for discussion for over a month and then last week this was put on
23:56
chain for a vote members voted on this Improvement proposal to add usdc to the capital pool so the mutual can sell usdc
24:03
denominated cover this is also a requirement for certain products that were actively developing and it's been a
24:09
feature requested by members in the past this proposal did pass and usdc was added on chain yesterday while the Nexus
24:16
Mutual up uh UI was updated today to allow members to buy usdc nominated cover um we have a tweet that's
24:23
scheduled to go out here just shortly after this call um with the details but basically if you're looking to buy
24:28
coverage for certain products you know you'll want to use usdc we've had people
24:33
in the past ask if they can buy usdc denominated cover for makeer Dow CDP um
24:39
s die the SD cover that we offer spark protocol cover some of these things
24:45
where you know the asset that you're looking to cover is D and getting a payout in D when you're worried about
24:50
the security of D um is is a little redundant so um with usdc added in the
24:56
capital pool we can also offer some new cover products such as depa cover that's an active de development um if you have
25:04
usdc as a payout asset we can underwrite cover for things like a die dpay cover
25:10
or something like an sde dpay cover so um that's not available yet but actively
25:15
being developed and this was one of the requirements for that product to go live
25:21
so more on that in the future um there's also a proposal from the investment committee that is a
25:26
request for comment it is a divestment framework um I actually believe that while we're on this while we are on this
25:32
call that this has been updated to an nmip but the divestment framework has been on the forum for a little over two
25:38
weeks and Rey who is heading up the investment committee posted an RFC
25:43
outlining a framework for divesting from steth and reth in the capital pool to
25:49
meet certain obligations over time as part of this framework the investment committee is proposing um that the
25:55
mutual maintain a minimum of Dy and eth in the pool to provide liquidity for claim payments
26:01
should there be a loss event 9,000 eth as liquidity for Ram redemptions and
26:06
then 3,000 e to be used as collateral available for the usdc loan that's
26:12
associated with the cover red deal um as R redemptions continue the amount of eth
26:18
in the capital pool will reduce and so the mutual needs to ensure that we have enough eth liquidity to honor
26:23
redemptions and facilitate claim payouts should a loss event occur so this proposal on the Forum outlines um when
26:31
stth or re eth would be redeemed for eth in the capital pool um and under which
26:36
circumstances we would start to divest so it's a pretty detailed post uh the investment committee has put a lot of
26:42
thought and foresight into that post so I recommend everybody check that out um you can find that detailed breakdown on
26:49
the Forum and again I believe this is now in the nmip uh phase so this will be
26:55
up for review for at least the next two weeks before it goes to a vote on the investment proposal side there
27:01
are several investment related proposals that I expect to be posted on the Forum here in the next couple of weeks um the
27:06
investment committee has given me an update here that they are uh working with some different teams who are
27:13
looking to discuss how we allocate the idle assets held in the enzyme vaults so
27:19
keep an eye out on the forum for those rfc's uh I believe there are going to be
27:24
two that'll be posted on the Forum um and then there may be some other proposals for related to treasury
27:29
management coming on the Forum in the near future as well but once those proposals go up we'll share announcements on Discord and Twitter um
27:37
so if you're following the Nexus Mutual Dow account or the main Nexus mutual account on Twitter um or if you're in the Discord server just keep an eye out
27:44
uh over the next couple weeks for those proposals on P out proposals um we've
27:50
already covered the grad accelerator program uh I also wanted to just give an update on nmdp number five which
27:57
authorized the creation the Nexus Mutual Community staking pool so this was a
28:02
continuation of basically a governance vot that happened a couple years ago about creating a staking pool where the
28:07
treasury um the Dow treasury can open up capacity for certain products to help with growth and then earn staking
28:15
rewards um based on cover sold so this was approved by members in May and the
28:21
community staking pool was created this is pool number 23 and you can see that in this on the staking page in the nextal UI and and there have been
28:28
covered by red through that pool so that pool is already earning 1.73% um so you can see that it's also a
28:35
public pool um and you know this should help us scale cover sales there's been
28:41
multiple instances where you know capacity was constrained in other pools and pricing was very high in other pools
28:47
so cover Vis have been routed to the community staking pool it's been really great at opening up capacity as new
28:52
listings come online it'll help us open up more capacity and help us find out what people want to buy cover for while
28:58
generating some returns for the Dow treasury members also boed to approve nmdp number four which was a great
29:06
proposal that open cover had put up um they were awarded 230 nxm to offset gas costs and help them scale cover sales on
29:12
l2s and then to date you know open cover has grown their cover sales substantially in Q2 um last year in the
29:20
fall after they launched cover sales uh you know were steady but not very high
29:25
and in the last two quarters they've substantially ran up their cover sales so you know we're seeing a lot of growth
29:31
through open cover their growth team is working very hard to get Integrations in
29:36
different uh protocols and l2s and so we are seeing a lot of cover buys being routed through there so again they're
29:41
just a really great partner building on top of the mutual and on the investment committee side um they've been working
29:47
again with those various teams to post proposals on the Forum they've been Fielding questions and providing these teams with guidance on their Governor's
29:53
proposals so working to get those in good shape so that they have all the information that members need to to make decisions and ask questions and then the
30:00
IC has also started providing monthly updates on the mutuals investment earnings which you can find in the
30:05
investment category on the Forum we've also been sharing these on Twitter for the Nexus Mutual Dow account so based on
30:11
these reports in March the mutual earned 57.2 eth on investments and in April the
30:16
mutual earned 141.5 eth on investments the main newsletter should be posted in the next week or so so keep an eye out
30:23
for that but they've given a really good overview of flows how much has left the
30:28
capital pool based on RAM redemptions how much is coming in through uh cover
30:33
premiums and then how much we are earning on our investment assets and and what that looks like over time so you
30:40
can find the latest on the investment communities progress on the Nexus Mutual governance Forum as well I will hand
30:46
things over to samim to go over the last week in numbers Sam thanks Brave let's review the last
Last Week in Cover Sales
30:53
week and cover sales last week um the mutual sold $16.6
31:00
Million worth of cover and our members earned more than $85,000 in fees some of the largest
31:08
cover buys were for Pendle a and the rest were less than $ million uh worth
31:15
of covers like we mentioned earlier in this call our active cover amount has seen
31:23
more than100 million um since later in May
31:28

31:35
information about and we are just getting started with a new project to um
31:41
