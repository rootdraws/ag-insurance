video, we'll show you how to find and

Step one, access the UI at

0:28
First, go to app.n nexusmutual.io.
0:32
To proceed with a purchase, you will
0:35
need to connect your wallet and be a

No problem. You can still explore
0:42
listings and check pricing before
0:45
joining us.
0:48
Step two, search for listings.
0:52
On the cover section of the UI, you will
0:54
see a list of cover options. By default,
0:58
public listings available to all users
1:00
are displayed.
1:03
If you're looking for a specific
1:05
protocol or category, let's see how you
1:08
can find it.
1:10
Use the search bar to quickly find a
1:13
protocol.
1:15
You can also browse by category or
1:17
product type using the drop- down menus.
1:21
Each listing shows key details.
1:25
Annual cover fee, the cost of coverage
1:28
per year, available capacity, the amount
1:32
of cover available.
1:34
If a listing has no available capacity,
1:38
click request capacity and submit the
1:41
form. The product and risk team will
1:44
reach out via email. Once you found the
1:47

looking for, click on it to see more
1:51
details.
1:53
If you're purchasing Nexus Mutual cover,

2:07
To get an accurate quote, simply enter
2:11
your address or multiple addresses in
2:14
the covered wallet addresses field.
2:19
We use the bank to calculate your
2:21
portfolio's value and show the suggested
2:24
value to make sure you're covering all
2:27
your assets. If your cover amounts too
2:30
low, your payout might get reduced.
2:34
It's smart to go with the suggested
2:36
value when getting your quote to ensure
2:39
your payout is made in full.
2:43
Review and finalize.
2:46
Double check the cover amount, period,
2:48
and cost in the overview section to the
2:51
right. Adjust slippage if necessary.
2:56
Select your payment method from the
2:58
drop-down under cover cost.
3:02
Ensure your wallet is connected and that
3:05
spending is approved for the required
3:07
amount.
3:08
Finally, click purchase cover and
3:11
confirm the transaction in your wallet.
3:15
That's it. Your cover is now active. You
3:18
can manage your covers anytime from the

your covers section on the main cover
3:23
