hi everyone this is d5 dad today i'm going to walk you through how to buy smart contract cover
0:35
or what i refer to commonly as insurance with nexus mutual so i've been using
0:41
nexus mutual since november 2019 they've been around about one year
0:46
and i use this to protect my assets that are deposited into defy applications this is like car insurance
0:53
but for protecting my defy assets so you can see an example here of a
0:59
quote for ave where i've got 10 eth that i want to ensure i get a payout for
1:04
so this is how much i would get paid out over the next 30 days and i would pay 0.0780 ether which is a 9.5
1:12
annualized premium so we're going to talk all about how this works today how i can protect my assets in defy by
1:19
using nexus mutual but also how nexus mutual operates as a people-powered alternative to
1:25
insurance that is built on ethereum using smart contracts
1:34
before we get started on how to buy smart contract cover you have to understand what nexus mutual
1:41
is and how it's actually operating so they call themselves a people-powered
1:46
alternative to insurance it's very much like every other defy application
1:52
the idea is to create a flywheel that is driven by the code or smart contracts
1:57
that are powering the application the idea is to decentralize and to allow this code to provide a more
2:04
effective and you know a more efficient alternative to let's say a legacy insurance company and
2:11
so there's two sides to this that we're going to cover today one is how do i protect myself and buy smart
2:19
contract cover essentially how do i buy like car insurance but for defy
2:25
and what's cool about this is you can get quoted and it's really straightforward to to figure
2:31
out how much it's going to cost and for whatever customizable amount of time you want
2:36
in order to protect your assets that are deposited into defy applications on the other side of that
2:43
is those that own a part of the mutual these are folks that buy the nxm
2:48
token which powers nexus mutual this is what allows nexus mutual to provide smart contract
2:55
cover but it also is a way of growing a quote unquote healthy
3:00
mutual over time that allows it to continue to offer even more
3:05
and more cover for this like rapidly growing defy space
3:11
at this time nexus mutual only offers smart contract cover and that's a pretty big endeavor because
3:17
they are the only folks who actually offer this sort of cover there is a secondary offering
3:25
from open with a y uh you can buy what is essentially a put option but
3:31
it's protection for your assets in specific applications like compound but it's very very very limited
3:39
at this time and so nexus is bearing the brunt of protecting us as uh
3:46
defy has exploded here over the last 90 days here it's gone up from one billion
3:52
all the way up to 4.46 billion long term nexus mutual is hoping to offer other
3:58
products like earthquake cover so i think it's just interesting to note that
4:03
while this is actually working relatively well they have much greater aspirations in
4:09
terms of providing this people-powered alternative to insurance at the heart of
4:14
nexus mutual is a token that is referred to as nxm and the way that this works is nxm
4:23
allows them to raise capital it allows them to create incentives that are aligned so
4:29
that the token is meant to appreciate as the mutual uh continues to grow and
4:36
as long as the mutual is quote unquote healthy which refers to it being over collateralized to be able to pay out
4:43
all of the insurance covers that have been purchased and that much more so that they always
4:50
have extra capital on hand and then lastly the token price is
4:55
meant to be linked to actual adoption of nexus mutual and it's meant to be also i think
5:02
unintentionally linked to adoption in d5 as i was saying
5:07
earlier total value locked in usd has gone up almost four and a half x since 90 days
5:15
ago and then even if you don't like that metric measuring it in ether it's still pretty impressive it's up about 55
5:22
what's challenging about that i mean aside from like all that growth happening at once is that
5:28
we really need to be able to scale nexus so that we have more cover uh and essentially more uh protection
5:36
against a smart contract bug which when i think about defy applications the number one risk
5:43
that is always present is a smart contract bug i will never be able to escape that
5:48
because it is it is always present and we've gotten better at auditing smart contracts and
5:54
and demanding that teams have their smart contracts audited but at the end of the day
6:00
it's risks that always exist so this is the one way that i know how to mitigate that risk
6:10
before i go any further if you're looking to simply understand how to buy smart contract cover i would
6:16
skip this part of the video and move to the next section however if you also are interested in
6:22
how to stake nxm and be able to earn as a member of the
6:27
mutual who owns a part of the mutual and hence is providing smart contract cover
6:33
by staking nxm against smart contracts then i would watch the rest of this so
6:40
nexus mutual is interesting because it provides this token that allows us to what raise capital
6:48
align incentives of the mutual with protecting uh the policy holders and then also
6:55
align it with actual adoption of defy and and ultimately the performance
7:01
of the mutual the nxm token uses a bonding curve
7:07
i'm not gonna go uh super deep into this but the reason i bring it up is because
7:13
i am going to show how i can become an owner of the mutual
7:18
and i can purchase nxm and i can actually stake nxm and then potentially earn a portion
7:25
of the premiums that are being paid by people to obtain smart contract insurance
7:31
so the way the token model works is if you look here at this curve this reflects price
7:38
going upwards as total funds of the mutual increase makes sense the mutual
7:46
is growing in terms of its capital and its ability to offer cover and that the token price should increase
7:52
with that now another part of the equation that relates back to why nexus mutual
7:57
is able to offer insurance driven by this token nxm at the heart of
8:03
how it actually operates is what's referred to as minimum capital required
8:09
now everything in nexus mutual is measured in ether and i think that makes sense because for
8:15
those of us who are early adopters in d5 ether is a store of value
8:21
it's a capital asset it's a transformable consumable asset that we use in most of the
8:28
different defy applications so mcr or minimum capital required refers to how much capital is required
8:36
in order to be confident that all claims can be paid so this is very important otherwise the
8:43
mutual would become insolvent and it wouldn't be able to continue operating on offering uh smart contract cover so if
8:50
we know that the total amount of funds in the mutual which is referred to as the capital pool
8:56
needs to grow in order for the mutual to continue to operate and offer more smart
9:03
contract cover and if we know that minimum capital required also needs to grow
9:08
that's another part of the equation here measured in ether that affects the price then we can start
9:15
to come up with what is this price of nxm so nxm is different than a token that you
9:22
would find in another protocol where it ends up trading on let's say a
9:28
dex and buyers and sellers dictate the price here nxm is minted on nexus mutual
9:36
and you want to exchange that nxm for the underlying ether that you might have
9:41
in the mutual as an owner of the mutual so this equation here these are just constants
9:50
so i'm just going to ignore them they were calculated to enable them to launch and
9:56
create that that curve the bonding curve but what you're looking at is minimum capital
10:01
required in ether which has traditionally been rising by one percent
10:06
daily the idea is to continue to push the mutual to grow in terms of capital so that it
10:12
can continue to offer more and more smart contract cover and then here you notice this mcr
10:20
percentage this refers to the amount of capital in the pool divided by
10:26
minimum capital required and here's a really simple example to sort of bring this to
10:32
life over time we have this capital pool and it's growing
10:37
because of two different reasons one is there are uh folks like me who think
10:43
that the mutual from a business standpoint makes sense and that i want people to be able to have smart
10:49
contract cover and so i'm putting ether into the mutual and i'm ultimately taking nxm
10:57
as the token another reason is others are buying smart contract cover so that's also increasing the capital pool
11:04
because just like car insurance you pay a little premium for protection in case of a
11:11
catastrophic event so those two things are contributing to this capital pool
11:16
on the bottom of the equation minimum capital required is the thing that's actually growing by one percent daily so
11:23
this is a fraction and it means that we need the capital pool to grow faster than the bottom of
11:30
the fraction in order for mcr percentage to continue to grow and for the nxm token to
11:37
appreciate which more importantly has to do with the mutual continuing to grow
11:42
and be over collateralized and hence be able to offer smart contract cover now a similar but different example is
11:50
let's pretend that as we focus on the capital pool again the top part of the
11:56
fraction let's pretend that uh folks aren't buying smart contract cover anymore
12:01
well that's not good that indicates that there's less adoption of nexus mutual and that
12:07
people don't believe in the product and so the capital pool would not be growing as
12:12
quickly or potentially shrinking another thing is uh if the capital pool is shrinking
12:18
because of large payouts because of smart contract bugs and because we're having to pay off all
12:26
of these policy holders who had insurance against those smart contract bugs
12:31
so this really incentivizes being well designed like any insurance mutual to be able to
12:40
cover uh what folks are are purchasing but to not also overextend the risk that
12:46
we can take on and so in this example the capital pool's shrinking
12:52
mcr is mostly unchanged it could be going up still one percent daily but let's pretend it's
12:58
mostly unchanged here and so the price would fall and and that is how the nxm
13:03
token works so the reason i share this is because defy is growing exponentially you know
13:09
you can see that here and the mutual recognized that they wouldn't be able to grow fast enough
13:15
the way that their minimum capital required was increasing one percent uh daily so in other words they wouldn't
13:23
have enough funds to ever catch up with the growth of defy so instead they decided to increase
13:30
the minimum capital required this part of the equation by one percent every four hours as long
13:37
as mcr percentage is greater than 130 percent so this uh has been actually suppressing
13:44
the price of nxm which is uh helping to bring down the price
13:50
and then ultimately it attracts more capital and you can actually see that here if
13:55
you go to uh nexus tracker dot io while i can see
14:00
that over the last six months the active cover so this is insurance the amount of
14:07
insurance that's been bought and this is being measured and let's make sure that's measured in ether here
14:13
so it's around 50 000 ether of cover has been bought and while that indicates that nexus
14:19
mutual is clearly valued i mean you can see that it's grown from what july
14:25
2019 from about 1300 ether in terms of total insurance bought
14:32
uh to now it would be cover for almost what is that almost 50
14:38
000 ether 47 000 48 000 ether but going back to the nxm token
14:45
if we look at the capital pool you can see that the capital poll size is growing like crazy so since
14:53
july 1st it was around 4 million in us dollars let's switch
14:59
this over to ether again so since july 1st we've grown from about
15:05
17.8 000 uh ether
15:10
to about 55 and a half thousand ether the other part of the equation we
15:17
talked about the bottom of the denominator so you look here capital pool
15:23
was around 55 000 ether the bottom the minimum capital required
15:28
this is the thing that's increasing one percent every four hours to push the mutual to be able to uh attract more capital
15:37
and ultimately offer more smart contract cover you can see here that minimum capital
15:43
required which goes up exponentially from july 13th or so and onward
15:51
now the mutual is saying that it requires 42 722
15:58
ether and then the last part of that
16:04
is if we take capital pool the 55 000 over the 47 000 ether then we get that percentage
16:12
that needs to remain above 130 percent and so as of today we're around 132
16:19
which is again the capital pool divided by minimum capital required
16:25
and this is just like every other d5 mechanism it's always about being over collateralized and maintaining that over
16:31
collateralization so that we can ensure that in this case we can ensure that those that
16:38
are owning the mutual don't become insolvent because
16:44
we've we've actually not had enough capital on hand to pay out all the smart contract covers
16:50
so now we're at a point where our capital pool is growing in nexus to offer more defy cover the
16:56
minimum capital required is growing one percent every four hours unless this uh mcr percentage goes below
17:04
130 then this mechanism uh gets killed
17:09
until we reach 130 percent and that means that the nxm price is also being
17:14
pushed to grow so that nexus mutual uh can continue to grow capital
17:20
and continue to extend more cover that's all i'm going to cover on the token model today
17:27
i hope that that helps to bring understanding to why nexus mutual actually works in terms of how they
17:34
offer this smart contract cover because that token is what allows them to operate so
17:40
effectively and efficiently if you want to learn more about this or review it further i'd
17:46
recommend going to nexus mutual dot io slash token hyphen model
17:56
in order to buy protection for my assets that are deposited into defy
18:01
applications you want to go to nexusmutual.io click on get a quote
18:07
now this is the interface that is actually going to be replaced in the coming weeks
18:13
so if you're watching this in the future you won't recognize this and we're going to skip to the new interface
18:18
but if you're using the old interface this is what it looks like and it's
18:24
pretty straightforward if i want to quote how much it's going to cost to protect my assets
18:30
it's really simple let's start with pretending that i have 10 ether in ave so all i did is i
18:37
clicked on ave and it fills in the smart contract address so this is where you are filling in the
18:43
addresses of whatever application it is and they've got these shortened smart
18:50
contract addresses that represent the actual address below this is all a part of just making it
18:55
easier for you to pick the application in the new interface it's a lot easier
19:02
uh you'll notice first off that the text and all of this is much larger so it's
19:08
easier to read and if i just click on cover i can click buy cover and then i can choose from
19:15
the many more applications that are available here you actually can try to paste in a smart
19:22
contract address here although i i would assume that most of us
19:27
that are new to this aren't savvy enough to know that smart contract address it's normally a matter of picking out
19:34
where is my money is my money in an argent wallet is it in a balancer pool
19:40
is it in compound do i have money in a stablecoin pool but it's also
19:46
staked partially in iron.finance where is that there we go
19:52
so here's an example if i have money in the curve y pool but i then have staked
19:59
my lp token in irn.finance i need to actually buy both of these because it's two different
20:07
uh risks that i'm exposed to with two different platforms in terms of
20:12
smart contract bugs so let's go ahead and choose uh in this case let's keep it really simple
20:19
and we'll choose the curved stablecoin pool so i'm going to go ahead and put in
20:24
however many days i want protection for it is a minimum of 30 days but you can
20:30
put in as many as you want so i could put in here 45 days i could put in 365 days
20:37
i'd recommend being conservative with this unless you know that you're keeping
20:44
funds in a pool for something like a year which is kind of rare in d5
20:49
there's a lot of liquidity that's shifting around so you know think about being more
20:56
uh incremental in terms of how how i buy this insurance so i'm just
21:02
going to buy 30 days of cover and then you'll notice there's no more capacity available so
21:09
there's more staking that's needed in order for me to be able to buy cover so let's go ahead and go back click on
21:16
cover click buy cover and let's look for another application that i have money in
21:25
so let's choose mstable i've got some money in m stable so i'll choose that uh by the way
21:32
i don't even have to have money in any of these applications if you want to bet that there's a smart contract bug
21:39
in one of them you can buy cover and whatever the premium is that you pay
21:44
you will get a payout if a smart contract bug is discovered so let's say i want cover for the next
21:50
30 days and let's pretend that uh in this case i
21:55
can choose what payout i want whether it's an ether or die
22:01
let's pretend that i have 100 die in the application and then you notice i'm
22:08
going to pay in this case it's a 20 premium and you'll notice that certain applications
22:14
like uniswap you pay a lot less money because the smart contracts have been around longer
22:19
they have more audits basically they've been deemed less risky versus m
22:25
stable is a newer application and so they've deemed that this is
22:31
higher risk at this point because it's newer whatever reasons they
22:38
have so you'll notice i have the quote over
22:45
here based on the twenty point eight seven percent on a hundred die for 30 days if i pay
22:52
1.71 die i will have protection for a hundred die payout over the next
22:59
30 days if a smart contract bug is discovered in mstable
23:05
now normally i would just click continue but i'm not a member yet here so i'm
23:11
gonna actually register this address and i have to go through a pretty brief kyc process
23:23
now you're probably wondering why the hell am i going through any sort of kyc that is not what defy is about
23:30
uh nexus mutual is uh run by a team that's out of the uk and they are still in the
23:38
midst of having to operate under certain regulations and so there is a long-term road map to
23:45
them uh moving into a dow actually it's a not too long term i think it's something
23:51
that hopefully happens over the next six to 12 months but the key takeaway here is uh
23:58
this is a concession i have to make in order to use this right now recognize that by me doing kyc
24:06
i'm actually linking my name then to this address i mean potentially that data is out
24:12
there somewhere and so i just want to call out that risk if you would prefer to live without
24:19
smart contract cover from nexus mutual in order to preserve that privacy
24:24
there's definitely an argument to be made there and so you wouldn't want to go through this i'm going to go ahead and go
24:31
through it though uh just because i'm already a member of the mutual
24:38
so to become a member of the mutual i pay a really small membership cost this is actually a legal requirement you can
24:43
see it here so they they're not trying to charge us they just have to do it legally
24:49
and then i will become a part owner of the mutual and the mutual is a
24:56
legal entity you'll also notice that if you are in
25:03
any one of these countries due to the regulation that nexus mutual operates under still
25:09
uh based in the united kingdom uh they can't offer a cover to any of these different nations
25:16
all right so i'm ready to become a member of the mutual uh if you do check this out later please
25:22
make sure you read this yourself i'm skimming over all of this just because i'm already
25:28
a member of the mutual through a different address so i'm going to click confirm
25:35
and i'm going to end at paying 0.002 eth as always i checked the gas price at
25:42
eath gas station dot info it says that as long as the gas price is uh greater than
25:50
59 so i'll put it at 61 it'll go through in less than 30 minutes
25:57
and then i can hit confirm okay so after my transaction confirmed
26:03
which shows here that the membership fee is completed i clicked on membership just know that
26:09
you won't be prompted to do this but you need to click on membership in order to proceed with verifying your
26:15
identity and then this is pretty standard kyc aml stuff you have to submit your name and address
26:22
and some sort of id document which is like a driver's license or passport
26:27
remember if you are uh not wanting to tie a name uh
26:33
and an address to an ethereum wallet address where at least a kyc aml partner has
26:41
uh access to it this is where you want to just quit on this video and you won't be
26:46
able to get smart contract cover there is promise that uh they are going to
26:51
further decentralize into an actual dow and that this is part of their current operations that will go away
26:57
and the key takeaway here is that kyc will white list whatever the addresses that you have connected up
27:05
above so this is my d5dad.ethaddress and that's the one that i want to white list
27:11
so that i can become a nexus mutual member and i can buy cover and i can also buy
27:17
nxm and stake it to provide smart contract cover to others who seek out protection
27:24
so below i'm going to click on individual for myself when i get done i'll be right back
27:31
okay so i'm back from verifying my identity and now it's pending so i'm gonna have to wait for however
27:36
long it takes which says up to 24 hours just be aware i did have to submit my name
27:43
my address even my phone number as well as a form of id and this is
27:50
definitely one of the challenges nexus has right now i know folks who want to buy smart
27:55
contract cover but they can't just because they are unwilling to go through kyc
28:00
but if you are you can obtain smart contract cover otherwise uh i would encourage you hop
28:06
into the discord group for nexus and uh you can learn more
28:11
about the roadmap there and and how they intend to decentralize into a dow
28:22
so i'm back about 12 hours later and my kyc went through overnight which means that i'm now able to buy
28:27
smart contract cover this is the older ui i'm going to show
28:32
you the newer one in just a moment but just to quickly give you an example
28:38
of how i can get a quote if i'm still using the old interface for nexus
28:43
the hardest part about using this is that not all of the applications that they cover are here and you can go to the nexus
28:50
mutual discord group by going to nexusmutual.io look for the discord icon and then if
28:57
you search in there for something like uh cover
29:02
or look for a name that's not here like synthetics they have a a long list of all of the
29:10
short ens addresses to choose which insurance i want cover for
29:15
and so i've bought this before and i just happen to know that if i type in
29:22
synthetics.nexusmutual.eth this will load the smart contract address that is
29:28
cover for synthetics otherwise you would normally just choose and you can see you've got compound ddex
29:35
dydx exchange dydx perpetuals market uniswap v1 v2
29:41
nuo 0x uh instadap maker gnosis safe ave one inch idle
29:47
finance set or token sets and bancore and there's lots more you know newer
29:54
apps like m stable are available you just have to go and look up that list in discord so if i'm ready to quote myself for
30:00
synthetics i could say hey i got 10 eth i want a payout of 10 eth if a smart
30:06
contract bug is discovered whether or not my funds are even compromised it is all about if a smart contract bug
30:12
is discovered and again there's nothing else that is covered it is all about a smart contract
30:18
bug being discovered uh i can get a payout and eat or die so i could say i want to pay out one
30:24
thousand die or however much money it is that i'm i'm trying to protect
30:29
uh in this case i'm gonna do 10 eth and then we'll do the minimum of 30 days i can do
30:34
anything over 30 days as long as i want depending on how much value has been staked
30:42
against the synthetics smart contracts in nexus the other part of this equation
30:48
that we're going to talk about later is there are others who are putting up value to protect us
30:54
to allow us to buy smart contract cover and then we're paying them a premium and they're taking the bet
30:59
that there won't be a smart contract bug and that they'll walk away with the premium and that there won't have to be a payout
31:06
so we're ready to get our quote let's click get a quote
31:14
all right there's my quote again it's just like car insurance or any other insurance except i think
31:20
it's easier to get uh you can see it's going to cost me .06 eth and that's for
31:26
a fixed payout of 10 eth anytime over the next 30 days and so i could continue with that
31:34
and all i'm gonna have to do in order to buy that smart contract cover is i am going to have to enable the nxm
31:41
token first and then i will end up sending in eth so it's two steps per usual with most
31:49
applications in d5 built on ethereum there's an approval transaction which is
31:55
this approval to move tokens that would be in my wallet so that i can actually pay for something
32:00
or execute a smart contract and then after that we'll actually pay
32:06
in ether 0.0636 ether in order to get cover
32:15
so let's flip over to the new user experience that hopefully you'll get to enjoy with
32:21
this new design rolling out soon so it's at preview.nexusmutual.io please
32:26
be aware this is new and there could be bugs so let's go ahead and buy some cover
32:33
easier than what i was doing on the old interface i'm just going to look up synthetics there we go and then i'm going to choose
32:41
30 days of cover for uh 10 ether
32:46
and let's see looks all good to me here so this is what i like about the new
32:51
design or the the new dashboard here is that it shows me what am i actually paying
32:57
7.75 as a premium and that is annualized if i were to take
33:03
this out to let's say 365 days then i would end up paying 0.075
33:12
ether but i'm going to pay just a little bit less right now just for this demo and show you what it
33:18
looks like over 30 days as a reminder the the reason that i
33:25
don't buy 365-day cover in most cases is that money moves around a lot in d5
33:31
so if you know that you're going to be staking in synthetics and you're there for the next year hey
33:38
that could be reason for me to to buy myself 365 days of cover but
33:43
otherwise i'm a little bit more cautious and incremental in terms of how i buy cover
33:50
okay so i am going to pay 0.0636 ether that's based on seven point seven five
33:57
percent as a premium you can see that there's still a one thousand four eighth of coverage
34:02
available uh according to how much uh stakers have staked against synthetics
34:10
contracts in nexus or and they've insured against the the synthetics platform
34:17
so that's a lot more cover there that someone else could choose to purchase and then the last bit of it here is just
34:24
being mindful that i agree that smart contract cover is not a contract of insurance
34:30
cover is provided on a discretionary basis with nexus mutual members having the final say on which claims are paid
34:36
there is a governance aspect to this and so those that hold nxm they're incentivized to vote uh
34:43
truthfully you know whether or not there's a smart contract bug but none of this is uh automated yet you
34:50
know so if there were a smart contract bug i have to file the claim and then others who are a part of the mutual that
34:56
own nxm will then vote on my claim so i'll agree to that and
35:04
uh oh one last thing is you can buy your cover using ether or nxm but in this case i'm just
35:10
going to pay for it in ether so the next step is for me to actually click here i believe this will be improved
35:17
when they actually launch this but just so you know there's no other obvious step i will click buy
35:23
cover after we do this transaction so i click here all right and then
35:29
just the usual sort of transaction we do before every uh defy application
35:35
actually takes my money so i'm going to click edit to check the gas price it looks like
35:40
anything over 62 gray will get it done in less than 30 minutes so i'm going to lower this just a little bit
35:46
to let's do 68
35:51
and actually while we're here the price just went up so i'm gonna put it back to 75.
35:58
uh when when i check the gas station i always make sure that i click confirm shortly after just because
36:04
gas prices can change really quickly and i don't want to get stuck because my gas price is too low
36:12
last thing i'm going to do then is check the permission if i know that i am going to buy a certain amount
36:18
of cover and i know how much nxm that is the more proper setting here is to put in exactly what
36:24
that is so that i'm not giving unlimited permission i'm not quite sure what i'm going to be doing here yet so i
36:30
am going to leave this at unlimited and i'll use the token allowance checker
36:36
tac.dapstar.io to later on change that permission back to being zero all right so i've got
36:44
my permission properly set for for me in this specific scenario where i'm going to buy more
36:49
cover later and then i've got my gas set and we're ready to go
36:56
okay i'm back a few minutes later my transaction has confirmed so i'm now able to buy cover i'm going to pay 0.0636 ether
37:04
for cover that will protect me on 10 eth for up to 30 days and one last reminder
37:11
i do not have to actually have 10 ether in synthetics
37:16
under this wallet address these are policies or or cover that i am buying
37:24
uh that entitles me to to a payout regardless of whether i have assets in
37:30
it so i could potentially speculate on there being a bug in one of these applications and i could buy cover for
37:36
however much is available so let's go ahead and click by cover
37:48
so you can see that despite the fact that i'm buying uh only .0636
37:54
uh ether of cover which covers me for 10 ether like this is the premium that i'm
37:59
actually paying the gas fee is almost equal to it why is that
38:06
because of gas prices does this have anything to do with nexus is like nexus it's like
38:12
gouging me no it has everything to do with uh what it takes to
38:17
execute these transactions and it's a reflection of the gas price being 76 way notice if
38:24
if i were to change this to 20 grey now i'm only paying and 6.38 cents or
38:32
.01 ether so i have two options here one i could walk away from this right
38:39
now and say this is actually too much gas for me even though i'm risking leaving 10 ether
38:45
without any sort of smart contract cover i could also just lower the gas price
38:50
like i've done here set it and and just wait for it to confirm
38:55
now i run the risk of my transaction getting stuck because maybe the gas prices never come
39:01
back down to 20 gwai over the next day or so and i need to do another transaction and i can't do that
39:08
because these transactions run in order i will not be able to do anything with defy until this
39:14
transaction has confirmed a last consideration is maybe i was
39:19
intending to buy more smart contract cover like maybe i have uh 50 ether
39:25
of value in synthetics that i want to cover it would probably make sense for me to
39:31
push this all through in one transaction i don't want to do multiple transactions buying smart contract cover
39:38
when i know that i'm going to pay this much gas per transaction
39:45
so in the spirit of transparency i've rejected that quote and now i'm going to find a new
39:51
quote for more cover on synthetics that way i can make the transaction more worthwhile when i'm buying smart
39:57
contract cover so i'm going to click buy cover
40:04
and then i just search synthetics uh let's go ahead and cover myself for
40:12
the next 60 days so i'm going to buy 50 eat of cover
40:20
and i'm going to pay 7.75 as a premium and there's still 1010 ether of cover
40:27
available for others to buy against synthetics unless more nxm
40:33
stakers come in and stake their nxm against the synthetics contracts so that more of us can buy
40:39
smart contract cover
40:46
all right so there we go 50 eath for 60 days at 0.6368 so i'm obviously paying more in
40:54
terms of ether but for me it's about peace of mind uh
40:59
in terms of uh this ether that is in synthetics or the value that would let's say is
41:05
equivalent to 50 ether so i'm going to pay for this in ether i
41:11
am agreeing that smart contract cover is not a contract of insurance cover is provided on a discretionary basis with
41:16
nexus mutual members having the final sandwich claims are paid and since i already did the
41:21
permission transaction earlier i can just click buy cover
41:27
okay i am going to put through a transaction at uh let's do 70gway
41:34
according to the eth gas station that'll get it through in less than 30 minutes i am paying about 244
41:42
dollars in ether to protect about 20 000 of ether in synthetics
41:49
so i'm ready to buy my smart contract cover let's click confirm
41:59
all right i'm back and my transaction is confirmed so i now have smart contract cover for
42:05
synthetics and that means that i have 50 each of cover so that's the payout i will receive if a
42:12
smart contract bug is discovered and the mutual members vote to approve my claim
42:18
i've paid 0.6368 ether as a premium to have that coverage and i
42:25
am covered for the next 60 days or so through october
42:30
6th another convenience just in the new dashboard is i can see all of my inactive covers so these would be
42:37
uh covers that have expired so on october 6th
42:42
this will move over to inactive covers and i'll at least continue to have record of that that is tied to my uh ethereum wallet
42:55
i'm gonna end this tutorial with how to own a part of nexus mutual which is to hold
43:01
the nxm token and and put capital into the pool which a larger capital pool
43:07
ensures a healthier mutual that is able to extend more cover and i can potentially then stake my nxm
43:15
against other smart contracts here under the pulled staking then this is where i would go i can only
43:22
buy this nxm on nexus nexusmutual.io there is wrapped nxm i'm going to skip
43:31
explaining that today i can gain exposure to it but because of the bonding curve i would
43:36
much rather actually deposit my ether personally i'd rather deposit my ether into nexus mutual and gain
43:43
exposure to nxm that way but the caveat is that i have to go through kyc
43:49
so those are different things that i have to weigh in terms of whether i want exposure to nxm and how i
43:54
gain that and am i willing to go through kyc so let's say i'm going to buy one ether of nxm
44:00
uh currently i would get 28.69 it's priced today at 0.0349
44:07
ether and again that's based on the bonding curve so price of nxm goes up as
44:15
total funds of the mutual increase and more specifically it has to do with
44:22
the minimum capital required increasing which is an indicator of like long-term growth
44:29
for the mutual meaning that the minimum capital required to assuredly pay out all claims
44:37
is uh driving the growth of the mutual but also aside from that minimum capital
44:44
required is the capital pool the money that it is in the capital pool comes from folks like
44:50
me who think that you know nexus mutual provides a valuable service
44:56
and i want to be a part of the mutual and i can then take that nxm and again i
45:01
can earn premiums from others that are buying smart contract cover so today the active cover
45:07
amount or think of it again as insurance all payouts are equivalent at this point to
45:13
about 46 638 ether you can see a breakdown too of
45:19
how that fits across the different defy applications and then you can see
45:27
that most cover expires about a year out so clearly most are buying cover for the
45:32
short term you can see the expiration date down here and then it mostly ends around one year
45:39
out in 2021 i do not buy cover for a
45:45
longer durations because i'm just not sure if i'm going to move my money any sooner
45:51
here's the cumulative premiums that have been paid so you can see that they've been skyrocketing since may so this is
45:58
uh to me this is really promising this means that nexus mutual is working uh in conjunction with the
46:04
adoption of defy this means that we are seeing premiums go up and that more cover is being
46:10
bought according to this as well and that to me is a sign of something that
46:17
is being done correctly while we're exploding with growth we are also
46:23
mitigating our risk with smart contract cover so back to nexus mutual if i want to buy
46:28
uh 28.64 nxm or however much ether you know just
46:34
if i wanted to put in uh let's say two ether uh i'll get double and then i just hit
46:40
confirm and i would work through the same uh transaction you know as most d5
46:47
applications thankfully because i'm working with ether here i don't have to do
46:52
uh two transactions i'm able to just send ether with one transaction
47:02
all right so let's do a recap of all of the risks that i am accepting as i use nexus mutual
47:09
first off there could be a smart contract bug in nexus mutual that's right this is a chicken or the
47:16
egg type problem nexus mutual itself could have a smart contract bug
47:22
that is my top concern that's my number one worry in terms of holding a policy or holding a uh a
47:28
discretionary cover policy with them but also it's my concern if i'm holding nxm or exposed to nxm
47:36
the next risk that i want to cover is uh the potential for my ether to be locked in nexus this
47:43
could happen if mcr percentage goes below 100
47:48
so today it's around 133 percent and 130 is the threshold for what is deemed a
47:55
healthy mutual so it's 130 percent over collateralized then if mcr percentage falls to below 100
48:02
that means that now the capital pool is equivalent to or less than the minimum capital
48:09
required to pay out all uh policies that would then be the equivalent of a lending pool
48:15
being 100 utilized i wouldn't be able to pull my ether out so that's something i want to be conscious of that a large decrease in
48:22
the capital pool which maybe could be attributed to a bunch of smart contract bug payouts all
48:30
at once even though that's probabilistically unlikely it could be attributable to a
48:35
panic amongst nxm holders to get out of nxm so this really matters and and again
48:41
we're 33 percent above that 100 threshold where my ether is locked until
48:48
the capital pool grows more but it's something i want to be aware of if i'm holding nxm as a policyholder uh i'm less concerned
48:56
like if i have smart contract cover it's easier to sleep at night to know that nexus is healthy
49:02
and at 130 percent over collateralization or more but i've already paid my premium i own
49:08
my cover and as long as the mutual continues to operate uh being over collateralized you know i
49:15
should be assured a payout if there is a smart contract bug ever discovered in the defy app that i've bought cover
49:21
for the next risk i want to cover is governance and governance is uh
49:27
ruled by voting power with nxm so there is a core team to uh nexus
49:33
mutual but it matters how much nxm you actually hold and so you can vote on you know
49:41
different proposals like a lot of the other decentralized finance applications and so you can see here changes to
49:47
pricing model if we click into this
49:54
here's an example of a proposal i could vote on but it has everything to do with me holding nxm and you can see that
50:01
currently 61 or 62 have accepted it my concern in terms of risk is whether
50:07
someone could have an outsized amount of nxm and then end up voting uh for proposals that
50:14
maybe are not in the best interest of nexus mutual however i have been watching nexus mutual and participating
50:21
uh by holding cover for at least eight to nine months so i've witnessed how well they operate
50:29
and i've seen their governance in action so this is not something i'm personally as
50:35
concerned about but just good to be conscious of another risk has to do with whether my
50:41
cover is to be paid out in dye or ether if i choose die i'm accepting uh
50:48
the risk that the dye peg could fail another risk would be admin rights that
50:54
enable someone to make changes to nexus mutual i'm not aware of how they handle that so that's
51:01
something that i am blind to and i'll hopefully be able to figure that out in the future by
51:06
talking more with the team and their discord if you ever have questions you can go to their discord group
51:12
here they actually have it available here just to click and uh they always have team members in there
51:18
almost 24 hours a day okay that's all i've got for you today i hope this video is helpful
51:23
i i really value the uh trailblazing that nexus mutual has done to enable
51:29
smart contract cover i recognize that there are some concessions uh to make in the short term in order to make nexus
51:36
mutual work uh also there's the risks to consider that i've covered here but at the end of the day this to me is
51:44
one of the best options to be able to protect myself against smart contract bugs in defy in
51:50
fact this is the only way i know of to actively protect my assets that are deposited into defy applications built
51:58
on ethereum beyond doing my research on applications
52:03
understanding whether there's an audit trying to understand the meaning of what's in the audit this is the one way
52:10
that i can very simply go and buy protection thanks for watching and i'll look forward to making a follow up on how i am
52:17
staking nxm against defy application smart contracts and essentially providing smart contract
52:24
insurance for others to buy while i earn a premium from the discretionary cover that they are buying
52:32
