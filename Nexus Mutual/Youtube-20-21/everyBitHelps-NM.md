0:40
nexus mutual uses the power of
0:42
blockchain technology and ethereum
0:44
to allow people from all over the world
0:47
to share insurance risks together
0:49
without the need for an insurance
0:50
company
0:52
essentially people who join the mutual
0:54
become members
0:55
and only members can participate in the
0:58
network
0:58
to buy cover to protect themselves
1:00
against the likes of hacks
1:02
in smart contract code but members can
1:05
also stake on smart contracts to earn
1:07
rewards
1:08
they can put forward governance
1:10
proposals vote on proposals
1:12
plus they can buy and hold the
1:14
platform's native token
1:17
nexus mutual uses a risk sharing pool to
1:20
allow anyone to purchase insurance cover
1:22
or contribute capital to the pool for
1:24
future awards
1:26
and anyone can become a member by paying
1:28
a small fee of just under a dollar in
1:30
eth
1:32
and the nxm token represents membership
1:34
rights in the mutual
1:36
with all members owning the mutual
1:37
together
1:39
and it runs on a bonding curve which is
1:41
a mathematical curve
1:42
that defines the token price based on
1:44
specific financial metrics
1:47
and it can only be bought and sold with
1:48
the nexus mutual application
1:52
nexus mutual was founded by hugh carp
1:54
and are established as a limited company
1:56
in the uk
1:56
with approval by the financial conduct
1:58
authority or fca
2:00
to use the protected word mutual in
2:03
their company name
2:05
now one thing to be aware of is that
2:07
nexus mutual is not fully decentralized
2:10
and it does require some kyc to be
2:12
completed
2:13
with the hopes to become decentralized
2:15
in the near future
2:17
the mutual's first insurance product is
2:19
a smart contracts cover
2:21
for purchasing protection for value
2:23
storing contracts which are inherent
2:25
to defy and tvl this cover is pretty
2:28
unique
2:28
as it lets members buy protection
2:31
against financial loss
2:32
caused by another's misuse of a smart
2:34
contract
2:36
in order for the mutual to start
2:37
processing claims it waited to obtain 12
2:40
000 eth a milestone that they reached in
2:43
just two months
2:44
after its launch in may and down the
2:47
line they intend to move into more
2:48
mainstream products
2:50
and started building the platform on the
2:52
premises of providing against earthquake
2:54
risks
2:56
so let's jump into how we can start to
2:57
buy cover now
2:59
so from their site which is
3:01
nexusmutual.io
3:03
we can go to get a quote
3:06
now before we actually go ahead with
3:08
creating our quote as i said earlier
3:10
you will need to be a member before you
3:12
can do pretty much anything
3:14
including getting cover so if we head up
3:17
to membership first
3:20
and you'll need to connect up your
3:22
wallet and i'm going to connect to
3:23
metamask now
3:30
so with your wallet connected you'll see
3:32
here that as part of the agreement
3:34
it means that you'll own part of the
3:35
mutual and as i mentioned earlier you'll
3:38
also need to go through some kyc
3:40
to become a member and also pay a small
3:42
fee
3:43
of 0.002 east which is equivalent to
3:46
about 71 cents right now
3:49
now obviously when entering in kyc this
3:51
means that it's not fully decentralized
3:53
and that you're going to be linking your
3:55
address to your personal information
3:57
such as your name
3:59
so you can link at your own risk but
4:01
they do also have plans in the roadmap
4:04
to make the process decentralized but
4:06
unfortunately this is not yet the case
4:09
and you'll need to read the terms and
4:11
conditions as well as agree
4:13
and pay a gas transaction cost once
4:15
you've entered in your personal
4:16
information
4:17
such as your name address and uploaded
4:19
some photo id
4:20
under the membership section you may
4:23
have to wait to be verified
4:24
which can take up to 24 hours
4:28
now i've already got a membership on
4:29
another account so i'm just going to
4:31
connect that up now
4:32
and then move across to cover on the
4:34
left hand side
4:37
now under the nexus mutual cover from
4:40
here you can view the active east cover
4:42
amount
4:42
which is a currently 115 000 eth
4:46
and the amount of dye in here as well as
4:48
well as the total number of covers sold
4:51
and it will show any active covers that
4:53
you have in here as well as inactive
4:55
which are those that have expired
4:57
plus any claims that you've submitted so
5:00
let's take a look at how we can buy
5:02
cover
5:05
so from here you can select the smart
5:07
cover that you require
5:09
or you can use the search field in the
5:11
top here
5:12
so you'll want to find the smart
5:14
contract where you've invested your
5:16
money
5:17
and you may need to purchase cover for
5:19
two contracts depending on the number of
5:21
risks you're exposed to
5:23
if for example you've got money that
5:25
you've staked and earning interest in
5:28
so say for example you provided ampl
5:30
liquidity
5:31
and staked by the ampl geyser you'll
5:34
need two covers
5:36
one for unit swap version two
5:40
and one for the ampl geyser
5:43
so if we go ahead and select the
5:44
contract
5:47
and you'll then be prompted to enter in
5:49
the number of days that you require
5:50
cover for with a minimum period of
5:53
30 days here and a maximum of 365.
5:57
now the amount of cover that you choose
5:58
is completely up to you
6:00
and it will depend on how long you want
6:02
to keep your funds in the platform
6:03
that you've chosen cover for which could
6:06
potentially be shorter
6:07
rather than longer term and one thing to
6:10
bear in mind here
6:11
is that this contract doesn't
6:12
necessarily have to be a contract
6:14
where you've got money invested in for
6:17
example
6:18
if you think a smart contract has a bug
6:20
in it you can get cover
6:22
and then if it does turn out that there
6:23
is one in there you could get a payout
6:26
but let's say i've invested money into
6:28
the ample fourth token geyser
6:30
and i want a period of 30 days
6:34
i can then enter in the amount that i
6:36
have on that platform
6:37
and you can choose from either eath or
6:40
die
6:42
so i'm going to say here that i've got
6:44
one eath in the ample fourth token
6:46
geyser
6:47
and you'll see that i'm then shown an
6:49
apy
6:50
and that will basically show me the
6:52
premium that i'm going to be paying
6:54
and this amount basically varies on how
6:56
trustworthy the contract is
6:58
for example something that's been around
7:00
for longer such as uniswap
7:02
or the more audited it is the cheaper
7:05
the cover will be
7:06
as essentially there's less risk so once
7:09
you've filled that all in
7:10
you can then go ahead and get a quote
7:15
and you'll then be presented with the
7:16
cover summary
7:18
and this shows us our address the apy
7:22
the capacity which is currently showing
7:25
about 14 000 eth
7:27
it shows us our cover amount the period
7:31
and the quote amount which is at 0.0045
7:34
eth
7:36
and you'll need to agree that the smart
7:37
contract cover is not a contract of
7:40
insurance
7:40
and that cover is provided on a
7:42
discretionary basis with the nexus
7:44
mutual members
7:45
having the final say on which claims are
7:47
paid
7:49
and you'll need to click to grant token
7:51
controller permission
7:54
which you'll need to pay another gas fee
7:56
for here which you can always edit
7:58
and use in conjunction with east gas
7:59
station which i've recently uploaded a
8:01
video for
8:02
if you want some help with how to do
8:03
that
8:05
and once you've confirmed that you can
8:07
buy your cover and pay another east gas
8:09
fee
8:10
and your cover will then complete once
8:12
the transaction is confirmed
8:14
so let's take a look at buying nxm now
8:18
and as i said earlier you'll need to be
8:20
a member to purchase using their
8:21
exchange
8:23
and you can purchase the nxm token in
8:26
eth
8:27
so if i wanted to go ahead and buy one
8:29
eth's worth of
8:30
nxm it'll then show me the amount that's
8:33
going to be received
8:35
as well as the rate underneath now just
8:37
be aware that this
8:38
is estimated as the rate is set at
8:41
transaction time
8:42
and therefore could change and you can
8:44
then go ahead and confirm
8:46
and your tokens will then appear in your
8:48
wallet once that transaction is
8:50
completed
8:52
and the exchange can also be used for
8:54
selling as well as buying
8:56
so if you'd like to sell your nxm tokens
8:59
you can simply revert this
9:03
and sell your nxm for eth
9:08
again you'll need to give the token
9:09
controller contract permission
9:11
for over a certain amount of nxm
9:14
so as i said you can only buy nxm on the
9:17
nexus mutual site
9:18
however there is also wrapped nxm
9:23
so wrapped nxm is really handy if you
9:25
don't want to go through any kind of kyc
9:28
and you can purchase that on the likes
9:30
of uniswap
9:32
for those of you not familiar with
9:33
uniswop i'll pop a link to my full
9:36
tutorial
9:36
in the summary below so what can you do
9:40
with your tokens once you've got them
9:42
well first of all you could have bought
9:44
your cover with your nxm tokens
9:47
but you've also got pulled staking
9:50
so in here you can earn rewards by
9:52
staking your nxm
9:54
against contracts that you think are
9:55
secure
9:58
in here you can find the contracts
10:00
through new contracts at the top
10:02
or the most state contracts in here too
10:05
or alternatively you can also search
10:10
and under each contract it will show you
10:11
the amount of nxm state
10:13
plus the number of stakers so if we
10:16
select muna swap here
10:17
and click on to continue in here you can
10:20
decide how much you'd like to deposit in
10:22
total
10:24
plus you can stake up to 10 times across
10:26
as many contracts that you like
10:28
then you'll earn your rewards as cover
10:30
is purchased plus you can increase your
10:32
deposit
10:33
or adjust your stakes at any time then
10:36
if a successful claim is made
10:38
on a contract that you state against
10:40
you'll lose some
10:41
or all of your deposit and just so that
10:44
you're aware
10:45
unstaking requires a 90-day lookup
10:47
period
10:49
now with claims assessment mutual
10:52
members can earn rewards by becoming a
10:54
nexus mutual claims assessor
10:56
so you can vote on whether or not a
10:58
certain claim should be paid
11:00
out and members who vote with consensus
11:03
are rewarded with nxm whereas users who
11:06
vote against consensus
11:08
have their tokens locked for an extended
11:10
period of time
11:12
and any users who attempt to vote
11:14
maliciously or fraudulently
11:16
are subject to having their state burned
11:18
and kicked out for mutual
11:21
then we have governance which is all
11:23
rules by voting power with nxm
11:25
depending on how much you hold you can
11:27
vote on proposals
11:28
like pricing models etc and then the
11:32
final thing i'll show you is the member
11:33
dashboard
11:34
and this will show you the number of nxm
11:36
that you're holding
11:38
plus it also shows you voting on claims
11:40
and governance and details in here too
11:44
so that completes my run-through of
11:46
nexus mutual
11:47
