you
0:16
hey welcome to the interacts this
0:18
YouTube channel and interacts sio today
0:20
we're going to talk about Nexus mutual
0:22
Nexus mutual is a an aim at a
0:25
decentralized insurance company that is
0:29
available on the blockchain and the idea
0:31
of Nexus mutual and what they're trying
0:33
to solve is in insurance companies
0:36
essentially worldwide there there's this
0:41
number floating out there that about 35%
0:43
of the costs of the premiums and
0:47
everything that we pay into insurance
0:49
companies gets spent by the insurance
0:51
companies for their own expenses right
0:53
that it doesn't get issued back to
0:55
policyholders at any point for claims or
0:57
anything and the aim of Nexus mutual is
1:00
to use blockchain technology to try to
1:02
cut out about 17 or 18 percent of those
1:05
costs which it doesn't seem like a big
1:08
deal but that translates into billions
1:10
and billions of dollars and if we can
1:12
save that make it decentralized and fair
1:15
for everybody this is a good system so
1:17
let's delve into Nexus mutual and how it
1:20
works a little bit but before that we
1:21
have to identify how the traditional
1:23
insurance market works insurance by
1:25
definition is essentially a pooling of
1:28
risk so it's a bunch of people that have
1:30
some sort of risk that there's a a low
1:33
chance of it happening but if it happens
1:35
to me it's a big financial impact some
1:38
examples of this are if if if there's
1:41
some sort of storm or fire at my house
1:43
or I get in a car accident that can have
1:46
a huge financial impact on me there's a
1:48
pretty low chance of it happening so
1:49
what do I do i off load my risk you know
1:52
this pool with other people who have
1:55
this who have a similar risk and if it
1:58
so happens that one or two or several of
2:00
us have a claim against that risk
2:02
there's plenty of money in the pool to
2:04
to pay us out and make us whole that's
2:07
the idea of insurance so here's how it
2:09
works so you might have an insurance
2:12
company okay and and their risk might be
2:16
something like my car will say we're
2:17
going to insure my car okay so the the
2:20
insurance company is here and I say I'm
2:25
going to pay
2:28
a premium for my auto insurance okay so
2:35
I pay a premium and we'll call that
2:38
premium $1,000 a year to cover my car
2:43
now the insurance company to arrive at
2:47
that premium they look at things like my
2:49
age the type of car I have my zip code
2:54
where I live my credit any claims I've
3:00
had in the past so my driving history
3:04
okay and they evaluate all those things
3:06
and they plug them in some algorithms
3:09
and they say Adam here's how much you're
3:10
paying you're paying us $1,000 a year to
3:12
cover your car so my thousand-dollar
3:15
goes in there hopefully I don't have any
3:17
claims for a while but when the need
3:20
arises and I and I have a claim right
3:23
they they then have to assess whether or
3:26
not the the claim is valid right so I
3:28
let's say got in a car wreck and someone
3:30
else's car is damaged they have the then
3:34
outsourced to a claims adjuster the role
3:42
of going out and looking at the car
3:44
assessing with it my fault they look at
3:46
things like police reports if possible
3:48
they look at the at the car of whoever I
3:51
was in an accident with they try to
3:52
assess how much that will cost they they
3:54
talk to the body shop or the mechanic
3:57
whoever is going to fix the car they
3:59
they look at my policy they say were you
4:02
a fault or you covered did you actually
4:03
pay your premium all these other things
4:05
and when all that's okay the claims
4:07
adjuster tells the insurance company all
4:08
right you got to pay the money and if
4:10
and if this other car is gonna cost say
4:12
five thousand dollars to fix the
4:14
insurance company pays out five thousand
4:17
dollars to whoever it was that I injured
4:19
or hurt their car or whatever in the
4:21
process comes out of here and from now
4:24
on that history now goes against me and
4:28
from here on out my premium might go up
4:31
to fifteen hundred right because they
4:33
can assess that about me that apparently
4:35
I'm a poor enough driver that now my
4:37
premium has to go up
4:38
because the cost the risk that they have
4:40
of me is higher now all this money that
4:43
I pay in premiums goes potentially into
4:46
this pool of money with everyone else
4:52
who's paying Auto premiums okay now the
4:55
insurance company has to keep some level
4:57
of reserve here because what they have
5:02
to assess at any one point is what is
5:05
the percent chance that there's any sort
5:07
of claim activity right and they have to
5:11
make sure that they have enough cash
5:12
available to pay claims like this at any
5:16
time
5:16
beyond the reserve they can take that
5:19
money and invest it now they might not
5:22
want to be overly risky with that money
5:23
but they can go invest that money okay
5:25
they can go invest in stocks bonds other
5:29
other types of equity they can do then
5:31
some of them do venture capital some of
5:32
them buy real estate whatever they they
5:35
need to do but they can go invest this
5:36
money but they have to make sure they're
5:38
keeping this reserve so once they pay
5:40
out you know this little claim here then
5:42
they have to make sure that that money
5:43
gets replaced in the reserve okay now
5:47
most of this here is all kind of under
5:52
the purview of the insurance company
5:54
whatever company that might be they
5:57
might outsource to they might have
5:59
outsourced claims adjusters they might
6:01
have their own claims adjusters they
6:03
might outsource some of the data
6:04
collection they might outsource the
6:05
premium collection they might outsource
6:07
the investment management okay but this
6:09
is all kind of under their purview they
6:12
get the database they get to keep track
6:14
of everything this is obviously very
6:17
centralized but it's something that
6:18
we've come to just kind of be okay with
6:22
because we're outsourcing all that trust
6:24
and risk and the management of this pool
6:27
and everything to this insurance company
6:28
we're saying look we're okay paying it
6:30
to you you handle all this you keep
6:33
track of the the numbers and and the
6:35
money and the data flow and the
6:37
percentage and the claims history and
6:39
everything else we're gonna outsource
6:41
all that to you okay that's what the
6:43
insurance company does now there's a
6:45
difference between a mutual and a stock
6:47
company a mutual insurance company is
6:49
one that's actually owned by its
6:50
policyholders so if
6:51
happens to be a mutual company like a
6:54
Northwestern Mutual for instance Liberty
6:56
Mutual by virtue of the fact that I've
6:58
paid a premium I am now a a part owner
7:01
of the company so as they make money
7:04
potentially on their investments every
7:06
year and as they maybe have more in
7:08
reserve than they need they've taken in
7:10
more premiums and the claims they've
7:11
paid out they might pay some sort of
7:13
profit to me as a mutual as an owner of
7:18
the company companies that are stock
7:20
companies actually they are owned by
7:23
stockholders the same thing might be
7:25
paid out in terms of dividends to the
7:27
owners of the company so that's how
7:29
traditional insurance has always worked
7:31
now you can see that within here the the
7:35
the management of the premium payments
7:37
of all this data of the claims adjustors
7:40
of handling all this there's a lot of
7:42
money there right because there's a lot
7:43
of people in here there's buildings
7:44
there's software there's there's paying
7:47
of commissions there's paying of a
7:49
network of distribution and and then of
7:52
course there's paying claims so there's
7:54
a lot of money that goes out and and has
7:56
spent other than just paying these
7:57
claims all right so here's what Nexus
8:00
mutual is attempting to solve okay for
8:03
the time being we're going to go over
8:05
here and go to the the D Phi slash Nexus
8:09
mutual way that we're doing this okay
8:15
what Nexus mutual is doing is saying
8:17
look currently the only thing they're
8:20
they're insuring right now that I'm
8:22
aware of is smart contracts right so
8:25
they they have this smart contract
8:26
coverage so if I have a loan for
8:28
instance if I have a we'll call it a 500
8:32
not $500 $500
8:40
all right now as I talked earlier from a
8:47
video about risk my risk here is
8:50
compound is a smart contract right the
8:53
compound lending pool is a smart
8:54
contract smart contract code can
8:56
essentially have flaws in it they get a
8:58
false it could be hacked whatever it
9:00
might be and and I want to ensure I
9:03
might want to ensure that my 500 died
9:05
that's in there that's their enemy six
9:06
or seven percent is insured so if
9:08
someone were to hack this or someone
9:10
were to find a flaw and be able to take
9:12
my die out of this smart contract I want
9:15
to be kind of made whole so what I found
9:18
out is I can I can buy a smart contract
9:22
coverage insurance piece from Nexus
9:26
mutual and it costs me four four to
9:31
cover this five hundred die to die which
9:36
I paid okay now in the next hundred and
9:39
eighty days if something happens in
9:44
compound some out gets gets hacked
9:46
someone finds a flaw in the smart
9:48
contract code whatever it might be I
9:50
will and I file a claim I will receive
9:55
my five hundred die assuming the claim
9:57
is is valley I always see five hundred
9:59
die back from from this pool not from
10:02
Nexus mutual exactly but from the pool I
10:05
already five hundred died so how does
10:07
this all work and how have they found
10:09
the ability to do this so my three point
10:12
to die goes into here into this pool and
10:16
and forgive me guys and Nexus mutual if
10:20
we don't get this exactly correct from a
10:21
technical perspective but we're trying
10:23
to explain how it's all possible and why
10:25
it's even important right so what
10:28
they've done is they have been able to
10:29
outsource a lot of these a lot of these
10:34
roles here out sources to people by
10:36
finding the incentives to allow them to
10:38
operate and help out with the system and
10:42
they have to give them some sort of
10:43
incentive and that incentive as we've
10:45
seen with Bitcoin everything else is
10:46
usually some sort of crypto currency
10:48
right so I can go by I can be a member
10:51
right and I can buy Nexus mutual tokens
10:55
and I can decide to be a risk Assessor
10:58
or risk Assessor means I go looking
11:00
potentially the compound smart contract
11:02
and I go look I think is a really
11:03
well-written smart contract I don't
11:05
think anyone's gonna bust it up I don't
11:07
think anyone's gonna find a flaw in it
11:08
I'm gonna I'm gonna wager I'm going to
11:12
risk or I'm going to stake ten
11:16
Nexxus mutual tokens on this particular
11:18
smart contract right and there might be
11:20
several people staking their nexus
11:23
mutual tokens in here so so the the 10
11:25
and XM are kind of in this pool and as
11:30
long as this does not as long as the
11:33
smart contract does not get exposed or
11:36
hacked or anything else over a certain
11:38
number of days I continually get my 10
11:41
Nexus mutual tokens back plus a piece of
11:44
the fees that are collected of a piece
11:46
of this premium that's collected so I
11:48
get I can benefit so maybe and I don't
11:51
know if the math is exactly right but
11:52
over a period of time I might get 11
11:54
Nexus mutual tokens in return so I've
11:56
made some money by virtue of the fact
11:58
that I've staked part of my money on the
12:01
fact that I think this is a good smart
12:04
contract and because there are plenty of
12:06
people like me staking there are more
12:08
people that have invested their money
12:11
have put their money in this loan that
12:13
go look I'm willing to buy insurance I'm
12:15
willing to pay a premium for insurance
12:17
on this because there are enough people
12:19
out here that have staked some money on
12:22
the fact that this is a good smart
12:23
contract so it's not Nexus mutual
12:25
telling them it's a good smart contract
12:27
it's not compound telling them it is
12:29
it's some third party on the outside
12:31
that has said I'm going to stake my
12:34
money on it so much so that if for some
12:37
reason this is hacked or or there's a
12:40
flaw that's exposed I would lose my 10
12:43
and XM tokens so what what this does is
12:48
there's this these potentially
12:50
independent third parties that have
12:52
actually put their money behind this and
12:54
said we think this is good we're not
12:56
familiar with Nexus mutual or not
12:58
affiliate with compound but we've staked
13:00
our money on the fact that this is a
13:01
good token now if there is a claim if
13:04
this is hack if someone gets into the
13:06
smart contract not if someone gets into
13:08
my my particular wallet or or I expose
13:11
my private keys or something but if
13:13
someone actually does get into the
13:14
compound smart contract now you have a
13:17
whole nother system over here which is
13:19
the claims people so I I or or will say
13:23
Ron so so that there's someone else so
13:25
Ron might take his ten nexus mutual
13:29
tokens
13:29
say I'm gonna be part of the claims
13:31
process and I've you know potentially
13:34
filed a claim I said hey someone swiped
13:37
my five hundred die from my accounts and
13:40
them to their own wallet I file a claim
13:42
Ron and several other claims Assessors
13:45
might come in here and go look we're
13:46
gonna take our money now and we're going
13:48
to evaluate this and if it's true that
13:51
someone did break into this and this is
13:54
a valid claim we're gonna throw our ten
13:56
Nexus mutual tokens in there and that's
13:59
how strongly we feel about this Oh Ron
14:01
says yes this this is a valid claim you
14:05
need to pay Adam and everyone else out
14:06
there they're five hundred died that
14:09
they paid the insurance premium for it
14:11
so because he did that I can feel pretty
14:14
comfortable that he has the incentive to
14:16
give the right response right to be
14:18
truthful so this is an another
14:21
independent third party we're over here
14:23
you had claims adjustors that might work
14:26
for the insurance company or might work
14:27
separately for for a separate contract
14:31
here here is a totally independent
14:32
person that is incentive to do the right
14:36
thing because if Ron says yes this is a
14:38
valid claim and there's a vote on it by
14:41
the way there's everyone else here who
14:43
has Nexus mutual tokens and and is
14:47
assessing this claim as a voting and if
14:49
the vote is against Ron if it's 70/30
14:51
against him he loses his tokens so he
14:54
does not have the incentive to to
14:57
validate this claim for me if it's not
15:00
truthful right so the the point here is
15:03
that hopefully Nexus mutual has created
15:05
this system whereby everyone can get
15:08
incentives for different parts of the
15:12
process right I have the incentive
15:15
because I say look it doesn't cost me a
15:17
whole lot of dye to insure this $500
15:21
someone else can say look it I'm willing
15:24
to stake my Nexus mutual tokens which
15:27
hopefully have some value to them on the
15:29
fact that I think compound is a good
15:31
smart contract that people should put
15:34
their money into Ron might go look I
15:36
think this is a valid claim I'm gonna
15:38
stake my Nexus mutual tokens and if I'm
15:40
right and 70 percent of the people agree
15:42
with me
15:43
then I get that back plus a little bit
15:45
of fee so the idea here and the
15:47
importance is Nexus mutual potentially
15:49
has created this incentive system which
15:51
is the basis of so much cryptocurrency
15:53
now what's what's become so important
15:55
with it is it's created this incentive
15:58
system that everyone can have their
16:00
little piece so eventually what you'll
16:01
have is you you probably will have
16:03
people that will just be risk Assessors
16:06
or just use their money to invest in
16:08
being risk Assessors for Nexus mutual
16:11
and potentially other insurance type
16:13
product you know people that will just
16:14
be claims Assessors because they can
16:16
make some money at that you'll have
16:17
people that will just actually take you
16:20
know whatever is left over here they're
16:22
gonna have some that is a reserve right
16:25
and some that's available for investment
16:26
so you'll have investment managers that
16:28
are actually managing some of this it's
16:30
above and beyond the reserve you will
16:32
have whole whole new companies or
16:35
individuals or whatever coming out that
16:38
are able to invest their money and and
16:42
make more in certain ways that aren't
16:44
available right now because it's all
16:46
wrapped up in the insurance company all
16:48
right so hopefully this is what Nexus
16:50
mutual has created and it's a very
16:52
decentralized way to handle insurance or
16:55
the pooling of risk so that is kind of a
16:58
somewhat of a basic description of what
17:01
Nexus mutual has created and and what is
17:03
probably partly the basis for where
17:06
we're going with some decentralized
17:07
insurance using a voting system that's
17:10
important a voting system for claims
17:13
assessment but but the key again here is
17:16
the incentive system that's being built
17:17
to try to incent people to act in the
17:21
correct in the valid in the truthful way
17:24
so again that's our take on Nexus mutual
17:28
I think is pretty important I've I've
17:30
actually bought coverage for a contract
17:35
I have I'm seeing how it works I've
17:37
actually staked some of my tokens for
17:39
risk assessment so I'll probably be back
17:42
at some point and tell you how that
17:44
worked out hope you liked the video
