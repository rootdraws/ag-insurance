hughs background
1:13
today is hugh carp hugh is the founder and ceo of nexus mutual
1:18
a people-powered alternative to insurance nexus mutual uses the power of ethereum
1:25
so individuals can share risk together without the need for an insurance
1:30
company this is pretty cool hey welcome to the show hugh thank you very much for having me yeah
1:35
great to be here excellent great to have you here hugh to begin with maybe let's get a bit of
1:40
your background because i understand that you do have an insurance background and i think that probably makes sense
1:46
given what you're doing now but uh yeah fill us in on the background and perhaps your introduction
1:53
to blockchain yeah i guess i've been doing insurance for a little while now at 15 years or something maybe a bit
1:59
longer studied actuarial science um in australia in canberra and um
2:07
and worked for insurance companies for many years and then and then moved to move to london and um worked for one of
2:13
the largest range reinsurance companies in the world managed to you know lead a reasonable size team there and
2:19
was the ended up being the the cfo of their um life operations in the uk so i got
2:25
yeah i kind of got that kind of the background on on the insurance side of things from a personal point of view got really
2:31
interested in in bitcoin and the i guess blockchain technology that sits behind it and would have been
2:38
a 2010 or something i kind of discovered it i guess on some forum and um kind of went down
2:45
the rabbit hole a little bit like a lot of people have um i found it i found it really fascinating and
2:50
that you could that you could send money to to someone else with no no one in the middle um and i kind of
2:57
played around with it for a little while um and didn't really know what to do with it so i kind of put it i put it
3:03
down and um and always thought that was kind of i'll just file that away that was really
3:08
useful and then um and then i heard about ethereum um a bit later on after it had launched
3:14
and um that's kind of when i got really back into it because um it kind of triggered the the whole at
3:22
the whole if you can write anything statement then you can effectively write an insurance contract so um i kind of felt like that was my area
3:28
of expertise and um i always wanted to do something in the technology space and so
3:33
that's um that's kind of how it started really that was the german the idea and it kind of has gone from there
what is an actuary
3:40
fantastic well look here just before we dive into nexus mutual and and insurance
3:47
i'm i'm kind of fascinated by this idea of an actuary is that how you say it and
3:52
yep actually yeah i mean for the for the benefit of listeners who don't
3:58
know what an actuary is just explain explain what that is
4:03
yeah it's basically um mathematics and statistics and the idea being that you can predict
4:09
the likelihood of future events based on historic data and so you basically analyze past claims
4:15
experience um and then use that as a prediction to work out what might happen in the future and what
4:21
price you should set the insurance um at so um as well as doing a bunch of other
4:26
things but um so i'm kind of life insurance actually by background so do all of the really morbid stuff with mortality
4:32
tables and and death rates and all this type of stuff so um yeah that's kind of the
4:38
background that's right so the same way like you know traders and financial markets
4:44
you know a massive part of trading of course is is risk management and that's kind of what an actuary does
4:50
for the insurance industry isn't it yeah you kind of work at how much like what you should price
4:55
the insurance at and how much capital you should hold to make sure you're confident in paying claims they're kind of the two
5:01
broad roles and you know there's a whole bunch of different um things you can do um but those are the kind of two core
5:06
um functions that factories tend to do and not to not to dwell on it too much but
5:11
you probably be familiar with the work of nassim nicholas talib who you know he's obviously
5:19
has a financial trading background and also a statistics and risky management
5:26
uh background and he's a fairly opinionated character as well of course uh he's had some
5:31
interesting things to say about insurance forecasters if are you aware of what he he's had to say no but i'm sure i'm sure
5:38
it's nice interrogatory which is good yeah again i'm not going to dwell on it
5:44
all right let's not get sidetracked you've become interested in ethereum and
5:49
this idea that you can create an if then statement and perhaps create some kind
5:55
of insurance product so you know what made you decide to
6:00
actually go ahead and start building these products um i guess i was like yeah i guess i'm
6:06
fascinated by the technology and the fact that you can do things in such a different way to the
6:12
um current way that financial services operate the fact that you can run things in a
6:17
non-custodial way to me is a complete game changer you've got um
6:22
i mean i just know from the insurance industry that specifically that there's all these
6:28
rules and regulations and stuff that sit there and and they serve a really good purpose
6:34
and that basic purpose is to make sure that the insurance company has enough money and
6:39
doesn't mismanage it um so that it can pay claims so it can basically back up its promises that it
6:45
makes to customers and and so all of this kind of infrastructure that sits around things and the laws and the regulation and the
6:51
processes and procedures and so much time and effort is is put into making sure that this is okay
6:57
but if you can actually put that on the blockchain and have full transparency and
7:03
hard-coded rules that um everyone's aware of then all of a sudden um you can achieve the same outcomes
7:11
using a new technology that we just didn't have before and that has to strip out massive layers
7:16
of cost and those those benefits can effectively go back to um the members or the customers of um of
7:23
the of the products so i mean to me that was it sounds a bit um like you know quirky and in the
7:29
background and perhaps maybe a little boring i don't know but um to me it was just um a fascinating
7:34
technology that could achieve the same outcome in such a different way um and such a much more efficient way
what is insurance
7:41
yes hugh and look on on the face of it you know you use the term quirky and i think that's uh that's
7:47
certainly a good starting point but it's it's quite a crazy radical idea really to think that you
7:53
can offer a form of insurance to protect against things like
7:58
smart contract failures and what is already you know a fairly let's say a nascent
8:05
volatile industry with uh you know a little bit of a history of let's say quirks in
8:13
or or exploits and various smart contracts so it sounds like this is a product or a
8:20
feature that is desperately needed in the industry but also from you know a risk point of view
8:27
perhaps something that you know there's a little bit of risk involved from your side as well surely
8:33
yeah yeah of course i mean i mean insurance is just about risk transfer from someone um who's less able to take it to
8:40
a entity that's more able to take it and that's essentially what um what's happening here i mean it insurance has always been um
8:48
kind of at the forefront of different industries just blossoming like you know you go back hundreds of years and
8:54
um like the shipping industry and stuff it wouldn't have gone very far if you'd um if you couldn't get um like
9:01
buttery loans and other things like that that actually um if something went wrong with the ship and it sunk um then like the loan was written off
9:08
and etc so it allowed the kind of economy to take more risks and progress more quickly because
9:13
it had this safety net and so like um in some ways um insurance always kind of
9:19
starts off like this in in new industries it it starts off as a community-based approach help helping each other out
9:24
addressing a real need um and then it kind of hopefully helps the the industry flourish
9:30
and grows from there so i mean like this is in some ways we're using new technology but we're doing some very old
9:36
stuff from a conceptual point of view yeah no you're exactly right here and you've you've explained that really well
what is discretionary cover
9:41
you know uh financial markets are one of the uh the oldest uh you know
9:46
parts of human history and it's just you know when you're starting up a new market
9:51
there's uh some kind of hedging or insurance is certainly necessary but what's really interesting about
9:59
what you're doing here hugh or or what you know is possible in the new d5 space or or
10:05
blockchain generally you know it talk me through the actual process here because
10:11
we're using the word insurance but as i understand it that's it's i guess it's technically correct
10:17
but it's it's a little bit more nuanced than that right so what you're providing is is not a it's kind of a an insurance like
10:25
product but you know the claims payments are enforced by by token incentives and there's
10:30
there's a mutual and there's members and everyone can vote on the blockchain right is it
10:36
am i am i sort of on the right path here no yeah you're exactly right um so we're not um we're not legally providing
10:41
insurance it's what's called discretionary cover um yes and this is actually uh this is a
10:46
thing that exists today we haven't just made it up um it's uh you can set up these things
10:52
called discretionary mutuals and essentially it's just a club and the members join and they share risk amongst each other
10:58
and they decide the terms and conditions of what gets paid and what doesn't get paid and usually that you know and like like
11:03
we have they kind of write a document like describing what what the terms and conditions of the policy are
11:08
and then the members interpret that when an event happens and so the way we've done that is um there's a voting
11:16
mechanism to determine the claims um and so you people have to stake some tokens to participate in the voting and
11:21
then there's a um you know there's a process to um if there's certain thresholds ahead then
11:27
the claim gets paid etc um and so in in it's just basically a
11:32
club and and yeah these things as i said kind of operate today in a more regular fashion they don't
11:39
they're not kind of automated on um on ethereum or another blockchain et cetera um
11:44
but essentially what we're doing here is just kind of automating an existing structure um that works and um that works in real
11:51
world so and then the benefit we get is like everything's kind of automated and we can do it quite quite globally and um
11:59
yeah and the costs et cetera just drop out the bottom so and they go back to the members so um everyone kind of if you want to get
12:06
involved you can you become a member of the mutual which actually means it's kind of like a dao but um we also
12:12
have a legal entity sitting around this thing um so you sign up and become a member of the legal company
12:18
and um and then you get the the rights of the of the members etc so um so yeah it's a it's similar to a
12:25
dao or a cooperative or something like that yeah that's right and so just to talk me
who can join the mutual
12:30
through a little bit how that works in terms of who can who is eligible to to join the mutual
12:38
it could be anyone and what rights do they have in terms of you know voting
12:44
rights and and what tokens do they have to hold to uh execute those rights yeah so
12:50
basically anyone can join the mutual um we do have a there's a kyc processors and there's about um
12:56
20 or so um banned jurisdictions but aside from that um pretty much anyone can join the
13:02
mutual um and then and then you get um and then you can purchase tokens if you want so
13:07
if you can contri if you want to contribute funds to the to the mutual you can um some ether to the mutual you can get some
13:13
our native token back the nxm token um and then that's kind of used within the system for like voting
13:20
on claims um for also doing risk assessment which is kind of like underwriting like choosing which risks
13:26
to back and also for voting on governance items so if we want to change the system or upgrade a parameter or something like
13:31
that um but but from a kind of customer point of view if you just kind of want to
13:36
purchase some cover um then you can come along and decide which smart contract you want
13:43
protection against so say you want some cover against maker or compound or uni swap or something
13:49
then you pick that particular system and ask some you know choose how much cover you want
13:55
and then you can pay for the cover in ether or die and you don't actually have to deal with the
14:00
token too much it's just kind of in the background um so it's very um
14:05
it's very kind of easy from a customer point of view and that the token's more for the kind of advanced more advanced functions
14:12
where you want to kind of actively actively participate in the system and like kind of provide work to the system and you
14:17
can get rewards for participating essentially so it's very um
14:22
um yeah it's kind of splitting kind of two parts really so the kind of cool customers and then there's kind of the workers or the
14:30
people that kind of make the mutual run and provide the information to it so it can can actually function very interesting
expanding to realworld products
14:36
hugh well so in terms of the actual cover that you're providing so
14:44
you mentioned um you know i could come along and i want to get cover against like a make a smart contract or
14:50
something like that or you know a slightly bigger picture of you you know perhaps you want to get
14:56
cover against uh events like you know the dow hack early on or or an issue
15:02
with uh you know the parity multi-sig wallet those kind of examples but as i understand it your
15:09
vision is really to eventually even move beyond smart contract cover to
15:16
real-world products uh you know traditional insurance products like earthquake or fire risk or
15:23
things like that is that the case and and if so what sort of timelines and and challenges are involved in expanding
15:30
to to that kind of cover yeah i mean that's why we went ahead we want to be a bit more um general i mean
15:36
i think the um that we'll definitely say stay within like the kind of crypto native
15:42
community and risks et cetera for for a while um you know for several years i'd say um
15:48
the the thing is we've got a we've got like an engaged community and there are lots of risks out there in crypto that
15:55
are very very hard to get cover for from the regular insurance industry and that's kind of the key here the key is providing products that are
16:03
hard to either you can't get from the regular insurance industry for whatever reason
16:08
um and so that's that's kind of the niche that mutuals really work well in and and so you will start with smart
16:14
contract cover and then we'll you know move on to other things like it could be like centralized exchange hacks
16:20
cover against that or um like slashing risk on staking networks and all those types of things they're kind of like a
16:26
few kind of more obvious choices um and then once we've kind of got a bit more scale within the
16:32
crypto native space then we can start looking elsewhere um and perhaps doing some some real world
16:38
stuff um and things like things like earthquake or natural catastrophe type cover
16:43
are quite quite easy to um to implement um and you can actually provide cover on
16:48
a on a global basis quite quite quickly and access markets that the regulators
16:54
struggle to um especially at lower scale levels so um yeah so that's kind of that's kind of
16:59
the vision but um definitely definitely starting and staying within crypto for a little while and i'm making sure we kind of
17:06
harden the system and and also um make it build it so it's flexible so
17:11
our kind of idea is that if anyone should be able to come along and say i want this covered so and they come
17:17
they can come with the document that says this is what the terms and conditions should be and if there are enough members that
17:24
kind of stake against that then cover's offered at a certain price um and so we shouldn't
17:30
as the team we shouldn't be the arbiters of what products get um brought to the mutual we've aiming to
17:35
build a system that you can um bring any um risk to the mutual and if the mutual wants to cover it then
17:40
great fantastic and in the meantime hugh i i love this idea that you're yeah
DeFi risks
17:46
focused on on the crypto community at the moment and especially because
17:51
you're exactly right you know there are there is a lot of risk in crypto and particularly in in d5
17:58
at the moment and yeah i mean any uh legacy insurance company is not going to
18:04
be too interested in in talking to participants in the defy space so it's fantastic that you're
18:10
here so let's let's just talk a little bit about the what the risks are and and d5 at the moment and how you
18:17
assess those because i so i i've seen that you've uh you talk about
18:22
three main risks in d5 right so technical smart contract risk there's an external risk and there's an
18:30
economic incentive failure risk so do you want to just briefly cover off what what those risks are and
18:37
and what your framework is at nexus mutual for for evaluating and trying to price those risks
18:43
yeah so um yeah exactly right so kind of i'm when when i'm talking about risk i kind
18:48
of also exclude so straight up exclude like financial risk so like the price of tokens going
18:53
up or down or something like that i'm more talking about the failure modes where the with this kind of system doesn't work as it was designed to
19:00
and that's a great point here so what you what you mean there is just before we talk about those risks you're saying
19:05
that yeah there's just a standard risk of you know any token any trader or investor losing money
19:12
that's a risk of of the game that that's not what we're talking about got it yeah exactly is we're just talking about like
19:18
okay the system didn't work why 100 why didn't the system work and so yeah there are a couple of reasons like
19:24
the technical um sort of solidity code or the um the smart contract running on ethereum like is that did was that coded
19:30
correctly it didn't have a bug in it so that's like the parody of the dow hack type stuff um and so that's that's definitely what
19:36
we that's what we're covering that's our call um product to start with um and that's kind of a big kind of
19:41
scary risk right now the the next two are what i call like external risks so this could be
19:47
um something like an oracle um failure or um or actually a governance
19:53
failure so some someone might buy up a whole bunch of the tokens and maliciously change a parameter and steal
19:59
all the money or something like that um so that's a that's a bit that's a potential issue so it's kind of like external
20:05
external from the point of view is external to the smart contract um it's some outside actor not i'm not
20:11
working as designed um and then there's the the third category which i call the economic
20:16
incentive failure risk so often these um these systems will have um incentives or you know costs or
20:24
benefits for outside actors to do certain things and like maker for example has um like you know
20:30
auction processes and and things to make sure that um the dye die holds its peg etc um and so
20:39
they they require you know liquid markets or other things working and and those
20:45
actors being adequately incentivized to perform those actions and if that if they're not then perhaps um the
20:52
system doesn't work as it was designed and then something can fail or the die may depend or something like that so um
20:58
you know things like liquidation penalties etc so so those are kind of the three the three broad categories of risk at the moment
21:05
nexus just covers the first one the technical smart contract risk wanted to start focused and small because this stuff's
21:10
um all new and then we'll look to expand and we're looking to expand into kind of more broader coverage and stuff at the moment
21:17
so there are various ways of doing that but um we're starting more focused and then we'll look look more broadly later okay and hugh
Customer profile
21:25
can you tell tell me a little bit about who the customer profile is
21:31
for nexus mutual and i know that's a kind of a strange way of saying it because i'm sure it's a it's very wide
21:37
across the crypto ecosystem but you know is it like individual traders or investors or
21:44
or fund managers or is it uh you know developers and and uh ecosystems and d5 companies or is
21:52
it a little bit of everyone from from all those sectors i imagine yeah it's a it's a bit of a spectrum
21:58
that's for sure um the we've got um a few different groups we've got some like individuals like just um you
22:05
know traders or people looking to make some money in d5 et cetera um and now they might come and buy some cover with us and stuff that then that's
22:11
great um or they might provide some um capital for us et cetera then then there's a kind of another
22:17
group which is probably the funds are a bit more serious kind of investors getting involved in d5 and these these more and more of these are
22:23
coming um quite um regularly now and um and they're they're more savvy with
22:30
their risk management um and so they're looking for solutions like um like what we provide
22:35
um and so we've um we've had a lot of interest from them especially with this um the yield farming craze that's some
22:41
that's kicked off very recently um where you can kind of earn bonuses for providing liquidity to
22:46
um different protocols and so if you kind of know what yield you're going to get or rough yield you're going to get then
22:53
you can get slightly less yield and get and also take some cover with nexus but have it in a much more um risk protected
23:01
way um so that's kind of the um that that's a big booming sector for us
23:06
and i guess the other the other the other um customer group is really the projects
23:12
themselves so often when a project is releasing their own smart contracts
23:17
they will buy some cover kind of on behalf of early users to kind of give some confidence that
23:23
um if something does go wrong then we can at least refund you partially or something or we can do something
23:29
there so um and a lot of projects have started doing that and and that's and that's really good from our
23:34
perspective because it kind of shows that we're kind of helping helping out the ecosystem and um growing and we kind of think we're
23:41
a good partner for you know kind of every project in especially in ethereum um which is i guess where we're focused
23:47
um and so hopefully we just be able to support everyone get a bit more liquidity in their protocol
D5 portfolios
23:53
that's right and that's that was my introduction to your your company or or your product
23:59
here is you know one of our sister companies here at brave new coin is tecamy capital who have just launched
24:07
some uh d5 portfolios and yeah so you know people that invest in
24:13
in those portfolios are able to hedge their exposure if they wish um against smart contract failure through
24:20
nexus mutual and so yeah i think you're providing a a much needed and necessary
24:25
service for the wider crypto ecosystem thank you yeah we're getting a lot of
24:32
interest from those types of funds and stuff so um it's really great to be in a um in that position and
24:37
um our main aim at the moment is to is to grow our own mutual to get more
24:43
capital and grow in size so that we can actually help out more people so we've been we've been hitting our capacity limits quite um readily
24:49
on on especially on the very popular d5 um the yield farming protocols such
24:55
as compound and balancer et cetera um so people want cover on that um a lot more than we can currently provide so
25:02
um we've got a you know good problems to have but we've got to try and scale up our capital as well absolutely and look just while we're
DeFi vortex
25:08
talking about defy you know what's what's your uh sort of big picture vision do you have a view on on what is
25:15
happening with d5 and where d5 is going is the as the hashtag d5 vortex continues to uh
25:23
to suck in assets from from all around the ecosystem yeah i mean i think it's fascinating to
25:28
me it's a very um natural use case for for blockchain you know um it's it's financial asset and um it
25:36
makes the best use of the technology in my opinion um and to me i mean obviously it's it's
25:42
kind of speculators driving speculators right now um which you know is a good way to
25:48
bootstrap things but to me it's not where we want to be um like if we're still
25:53
speculators driving speculators in five years time i guess i'll be disappointed and but i think um it's a good way to
25:58
start and it gets us get scale and then hopefully um we can then start kind of exporting that
26:04
more to um to regular people once you can kind of abstract away all of those complex
26:10
blockchain stuff from them um so they don't have to worry about it and
26:15
and then hopefully it becomes much more useful and makes makes these types of financial
26:20
services much more accessible and i'm open to people that may not be able to get access or um that may have been
26:27
excluded um in whatever country they're in so that's i mean that's the type of thing that i'm hoping to
26:33
participate in um the speculation is i guess good and interesting for now but hopefully that's
26:38
not all it's got to offer yes yes uh indeed hugh and well i i guess on
Risk management
26:43
the on the flip side of this you have a background in an insurance so you're a risk management guy you understand
26:50
risk you understand the downside so you know my question is what keeps you
26:56
up at night in regards to i guess well defy or or the wider world or or
27:02
is there anything that sort of troubling you nibbles away at the back of back of your mind when you when you're
27:07
trying to go to sleep what keeps you up at night hugh that's a good question probably my kids but
27:13
no i think honestly it's in terms of d fire sometimes i i worry a bit that
27:20
people are just very keen to just throw money at anything if there's a really high yield on it
27:26
um and someone and lots of people potentially are going to get burned um but um i think
27:34
i think it would kind of have to grow up a bit there's kind of a um it's really hard to do
27:41
a kind of move fast and break things approach when you're dealing with lots of substantial funds early on and
27:48
i think there's certain places for for that and maybe we can just you know launch like restricted kind of
27:54
alphas that don't take in more than ex-dollars etc um or
27:59
and then we can progress to other stages but i just think we need to be a bit more um rigorous and focused and um
28:06
i guess a bit more professional and about clearly displaying warnings and and i mean that doesn't solve everything
28:12
but you know um but taking a more focused and a cautious approach on some
28:18
of these things even though one of the best benefits we've got um in the d5 space is the
28:23
the speed of iteration and deployment um and so i think trying to balance those two things is
28:29
going to be difficult and we're not going to get it right all the time um but we we also need to encourage um
28:35
teams to um to kind of you know not not put massive amounts of customer
28:41
money at risk really really early on very sensible approach i think hugh
Break
28:46
well let's go to a very quick break and then let's come back here and we'll finish off with the very famous crypto conversation

Hot Takes
29:28
capp he is the ceo of nexus mutual hugh i like to finish each
29:33
podcast with a quick round of rapid fire crypto conversation hot takes are you up for it yeah of course
29:40
excellent i just want your hot takes your hot fire take your best shot here we go
29:45
hugh where do you sit on the bitcoin maximalist to multi coin opportunist spectrum i probably wouldn't describe me
29:51
as either of those but definitely not a bitcoin max maximalist i probably wouldn't describe myself as
29:56
an opportunist either um to me it was more about the functionality and usefulness of what
30:01
we're doing yes look i think that's a very diplomatic and sensible answer here i probably you know
30:07
because i started asking these questions over a year ago when the podcast began and now you know 50 episodes in i wonder if
30:14
perhaps i should update that uh that question it's less relevant now i feel especially as as d5 evolved so uh
30:22
yeah all right well listeners get up get at me if you've got a fantastic d5 question to hit and
30:27
to fit in the crypto conversation hot take round i can probably make one up myself let's keep it moving hugh what
30:32
would you say is your firmest conviction crypto opinion that bitcoin is going to have a security budget issue
30:38
at some point in the future it's going to have to deal with it somehow don't know how but it'll have to
30:44
deal with it oh controversial that's interesting how would you how would nexus mutual provide cover against something like that
30:50
happening i can't they can't really it's good well to me it's a certainty
30:56
that something's going to happen um but but it obviously depends on the time frame that's the big unknown
31:02
but yeah of course yeah to me there's going to be a challenging challenge very challenging um um community discussion invite whatever
31:10
you want to call it but um yeah it's going to be interesting that's for sure no doubt all right well
31:16
speaking of interesting you're not in america so and look neither am i but to ask every
31:22
guest this question here who do you think wins the american presidential election in 2020 oh i have no idea really
31:30
um but i i think it's a choice between two terrible people but
31:35
you know um terrible candidates anyway i don't know i hope trump doesn't win but dope light is not much better so i don't
31:42
know yeah look i i completely agree and maybe i should stop asking that question as
31:48
well it just feels slightly redundant given that you know most of the world is on fire at the moment
31:53
anyway okay on to a brighter note hugh bill gates famously said we tend to
Blockchain in 10 years
32:00
overestimate what we can accomplish in two years and underestimate what we can accomplish in 10. what do you think the blockchain
32:07
space looks like in 10 years time well i i really hope that um it's
32:12
as a kind of said before perhaps it's really it's actually making a real difference to real people's lives
32:17
um rather than just these um gamblers and speculators off in a corner um i hope it breaks out of that um that
32:24
mold and provides real utility to real people that's what i hope we're doing
The future is here
32:30
great sensible answer i completely agree okay well hugh william gibson scifi author
32:37
he said the future is already here it's just not evenly distributed can you think of
32:42
an example of the future being here right now but most people just aren't really aware of it
32:47
perhaps this is completely biased because i'm in it all day but d5 seriously feels like living in the
32:52
future um yeah it's like the fact that you can get um like a new financial product off
33:00
the ground in the space of weeks compared to like five years or something in the regular financial world is just such
33:06
a massive difference that we'll be able to do things that we never even thought possible right now we're just
33:11
redeveloping stuff we kind of know but i'm sure there's a bunch of new stuff out there that we haven't even thought of yet
33:17
that's going to come out soon absolutely completely agree hugh though hugh let's zoom out what do
dystopia or utopia
33:24
you think is the long term what do you think is the long-term future for the human race do you see
33:29
dystopia or utopia oh i don't see either um but um i i
33:36
very much hope it's not dystopia of course um but um you know something like that could
33:41
happen um you know somewhere in the middle we'll constantly have challenges that we have to deal with perhaps i'm just being too reasonable
33:47
down the middle here but um but you know um it's not going to be utopia either i think that's an
33:52
impossibility yeah well lucky you're an insurance guy so i'd expect you to be reasonable and
33:58
somewhere down the middle and and hedging your vets as it were because it really it's a pendulum that swings back and forward
34:04
but you're always somewhere in between right yeah exactly all right let's finish this off hugh
favourite science fiction book
34:10
what is your favorite science fiction book film show or universe
34:17
oh that's a really good question i should have done more research um i'm not i i really loved um
34:24
akira um when i was when i was young um yeah and you know that's quite old
34:31
now but they just had me fascinated and stuff and i watched a decent amount of manga and stuff when i was
34:36
younger as well so um yeah that type of stuff got me fascinated and things but um more recently i
34:43
haven't haven't been able to spend much time doing reading books and stuff it's um it's been a bit chaotic recently but um
34:50
but yeah that's that's i guess that's my answer yeah you could i mean you could almost have said a d5 even if d5 is not a book or a film
34:58
or a show but it's certainly a universe and it's certainly science fiction yeah it is it is a bit crazy and out
35:04
there and it takes any time you have to explain it or you try explaining it to someone who've never heard about
35:10
it um you realize how mind-bending or like just paradigm shifting it is um and it just
35:16
takes a while to get over those those um initial communication barriers yes yes
35:22
indeed and look i love that you said akira though because yeah i remember seeing akira on the big screen
35:28
when i was a a very young man would have been as a long time ago this before it probably would have been
35:34
oh i want to say like the 90s almost um yes when it came out anyway um we'll put
outro
35:40
a link to that in the show note so we can let's finish this off hugh been a pleasure
35:46

35:58
more about nexus mutual and uh yeah what you have to offer yeah i know thanks for having me on um yes if
36:04

36:18

37:01
with akira that was the manga film was actually released in 1988
37:07
an animated film very very influential very much a cyberpunk story set in a
37:12
futuristic post-apocalyptic tokyo bikers you know um yeah full cyberpunk
37:20
aesthetic actually if you've seen the demo footage of that upcoming blockbuster game
37:25
i think it's called cyberpunk 2077. something like that yeah that aesthetic
