Welcome to a new episode at Economics Design today  we're going to cover part two of Nexus Mutual  
0:09
the last episode we talked about a generalized  economics of insurance so what are the economic  
0:16
inefficiencies and insurance how it's being dealt  with and what are the opportunities in there  
0:22
today we're going to dive deeper into Nexus Mutual  which is one of these insurance providers in Defi  
0:28
and we're going to cover quite a lot of different  things including the economics of the NXM token  
0:35
so we're going to get started with understanding  a little bit more about Nexus Mutual for those who   didn't watch the previous episode I encourage  you to go and watch it I’ll put the link up  
0:43
there and if you are new to the space then  I’m going to give you a little bit more deep  
0:50
dive about what Nexus Mutual is how it works and  how is the role very different in the Defi space  
0:57
compared to the other different protocols out  there then we're going to see how the system   the protocol actually works so how Nexus work and  then we're going to dive into the three different  
1:07
pillars of economics design or the three pillars  of designing token economics so we're going  
1:13
to look at market design mechanism design and  token design initially I also wanted to add in  
1:18
some ways to improve the entire system or how  Nexus Mutual or how the entire idea of insurance  
1:24
could benefit the Defi ecosystem as a whole  but I realized that would take up like 60  
1:29
slides and I didn't want this episode to drag on  for too long so I think I’m going to have a NXM  
1:36
video again for the third part so part three  and going to dive into the improvements and  
1:44
how we can use insurance in a broader  landscape of the Defi protocols   so we're just going to focus on Nexus Mutual  today let's get started with understanding what  
1:55
Nexus Mutual is how does the protocol work  and how do you get involved in a protocol  
2:01
there are two ways to get involved in the  protocol either directly or indirectly if   you want to participate directly then you have  to join Nexus Mutual and pay a membership fee  
2:11
now before you start complaining  about all of that the cool thing about   Defi is that there's always two ways to enter Defi  you either go via the regulated route and you are  
2:23
completely regulated you follow the government  you follow whatever regulations are in place   or you go to the completely unregulated way which  is how Bitcoin started you have anonymous founders  
2:33
you just have the code up there it's all open  source and people use it so that's one mechanism   which is the anonymous unregulated almost like a  neo-libertarian method then the other way is to  
2:44
follow the regulated systems in place which one is  better which one is worse this is not the purpose   of the video but these are two ways to get started  okay so Bitcoin did the unregulated way anonymous  
2:56
founder and all that kind of stuff there are a  lot of other Defi protocols that followed that   now Nexus Mutual decided to follow  the regulated way so Nexus Mutual is  
3:07
an incorporated company in the UK so you need  to pay for a membership fee to enter because  
3:13
they have to do KYC they have to do your AML  stuff and when you join a membership fee you  
3:19
are actually a director in this Nexus  Mutual company that's based in the UK   so that's pretty cool and that's something that's  quite different from the Defi protocols out there  
3:29
that being said that's the way to participate  directly and then once you are a member there  
3:35
are different ways to participate you could be  buying covers you could be buying the tokens   you could be staking you could be participating  in governance and all the other ways to be using  
3:45
and participating directly so that's the  direct way to get involved in Nexus Mutual  
3:51
the indirect way is to buy this thing called a  Wrapped NXM so NXM is the token that's used in  
3:57
Nexus Mutual and you can buy it indirectly  with this thing called Wrapped NXM WNXM now  
4:05
it's a similar concept of NXM so it's when you  buy one Wrapped NXM technically you can redeem one  
4:14
actual NXM out there but it's slightly different  because WNXM allows people to trade it on  
4:23
places like Binance like Uniswap whereas a NXM  token itself it's not exactly tradable because  
4:29
you have to be a registered member and you  have to do all your KYC to be able to own NXM  
4:35
so that's the difference it's almost like  NXM is not tradable NXM is only used within   the internal ecosystem and it's really backed by  math we're going to talk about math later behind  
4:44
and to get its value whereas Wrapped NXM is  more subjected to speculations because you  
4:49
can be trading it in the secondary market so  r Wrapped NXM exists you can go and buy it on  
4:55
Uniswap on Binance and a few other exchanges and  that's a way to participate indirectly now you're  
5:00
thinking why are there two methods to do that  simple the first one is if you want to participate  
5:05
directly you have to go through the whole KYC and  pay for the membership fee if you don't want and   you just want to speculate on an NXM then you  do it with Wrapped NXM and you don't need to  
5:15
be a member you don't need to do KYC you just  purchase just like your any other tokens out there  
5:20
and this is a pretty good system because  that all the speculation is done on the  
5:25
secondary market and it doesn't really directly  impact the value of NXM and the value of NXM is  
5:32
defined very strictly with tokens or with math  and we're going to look that look at that later  
5:37
I’m going to look at some graphs so this is  these are two ways to get involved and it's  
5:43
a very clear definition of the different kind of  participants that will be purchasing these tokens
5:50
NXM or Nexus Mutual is all about insurance right  you can it's ensuring your Defi protocols when you  
5:56
are purchasing these Defi assets and how do you  get started if you want to participate directly  
6:02
by buying insurance covers you go to the platform  and then you choose three things the first one is  
6:09
choose the asset that you want to get insurance  for so they have a few protocols they don't  
6:14
cover every protocol they cover quite a number  of protocols so for example I’m just using in  
6:19
alphabetical order that's AAVE so this it's  AAVE is a lending and borrowing protocol and if  
6:26
you want to purchase AAVE or you want to use the  protocol you want to use their platform then you   can buy insurance to cover just in case there is  a technical bug and your losses will be covered by  
6:37
Nexus Mutual so you firstly you choose the assets  then you choose how long you want to cover it for  
6:43
the thing is a lot of these trades are very short  term so you probably are borrowing and lending for  
6:50
maybe 10 days so you just put 10 days in and then  you also can choose how much you want to cover   for so think of it as buying travel insurance  the assets will be which country you want to go  
7:00
and then how long you're traveling for  and what kind of things you want to cover   similarly that's how Nexus Mutual works as well  if you want to buy cover the important thing to  
7:10
note is that Nexus Mutual doesn't provide the  insurance itself it provides the cover for it  
7:16
what does it mean it means that if there's any  payouts required or you know if something happens   or there's a bug in a technical risk in your smart  contract protocol then Nexus Mutual the company  
7:27
itself doesn't pay out it's a decentralized set of  participants of risk assessors and claim assessors  
7:35
to determine if you will get your returns or  not you know if you get your coverage or not   we're going to dive into all these participant  stuff a bit later but just know that this is  
7:44
slightly different from a travel insurance if you  buy a travel insurance you are getting insurance   from the company itself with Nexus Mutual the  funds to be dispersing out in case anything  
7:57
happens is defined by a distributed participant  the risk assessment so if you want to get claimed  
8:04
the claim assessors are also a distributed  participant and everything is just really   distributed so it's very aligned to the  ethos of Defi or the entire ethos of crypto
8:16
so having that aside now let's dive a little bit  deeper to how Nexus Mutual work if you want more  
8:23
details about you know the general idea of how  Nexus Mutual works how it links to Defi and the  
8:30
general economics of it just watch the previous  video the thing is this video will be a bit long   so I don't want to have so many information in  there because those are the primary you know  
8:39
very high level things that you can find in the  previous video today we want to go a bit deeper so  
8:44
how it works this diagram is done by Nexus Mutual  and I think it gives a very good snapshot of how  
8:51
the thing works so you have three types of people  in the system or three types of participants in   the system you have a member so these members are  you know people who sign up for the membership and  
9:04
paid for the membership fee and you can purchase  the NXM token not wrapped NXM but a NXM token  
9:11
itself so you have a member and as a member you  can buy cover and then you have two other types  
9:17
of participants the first one is a risk assessor  so risk assessor will check the risk of something  
9:24
and then the second one the third one is the  claim assessor so the claim assessor would check   the claims of something okay so that's the three  different types of participants right the member  
9:35
the person who defines risk the person who  defines claims how do they work and how is   it decentralized okay let's see so we have  Nexus Mutual as a platform to aggregate all  
9:45
these three participants together aggregate the  insurance covers aggregate the funds available  
9:52
as a member you let's say I’m a member and I go to  Nexus Mutual and I go to AAVE and I want to borrow  
9:58
something from AAVE and so I want to protect my  funds that are in AAVE so I’m a member I buy cover  
10:06
from Nexus Mutual and Nexus Mutual has some funds  available to be covering AAVE I like to cover  
10:16
my insurance cover for trading or for lending  and borrowing on AAVE so I could buy a cover  
10:23
now let's say the price is going to be 0.5 ETH for  example it's a lot less than that but let's just  
10:30
say that so 0.5 ETH and this is the and I want  to cover let's say 300 000 ETH that I’m going  
10:38
to be borrowing and lending on AAVE so the cost I  don't know what the exact these are just arbitrary   numbers but just imagine 300 000 that's boring  and landing on AAVE and the cost to for insurance  
10:49
is 0.5 ETH and that 0.5 ETH goes into Nexus  Mutual which is you know a big pot of funds and  
10:58
how does these risk assessor and claim assessors  work first we need a risk assessor so a risk  
11:04
assessor will look at all the different protocols  in in Defi and say that okay let's do a deep dive  
11:11
in AAVE we go and look in AAVE protocol and  then we audit the code we look at the general  
11:17
information that's on the code we look at how  secure the code is and usually this risk assessors  
11:25
they're experts in their own field so they could  be smart contract coders they could be developers  
11:30
they actually know the thing so they look at the  risk and they say okay you know I think AAVE’s  
11:36
protocol is very secure and I think this is a  secure platform I think this is a secure protocol  
11:43
and I’m going to stake some tokens on this on the  fact that I think this is secure so let's say I’m  
11:52
going to stake let's do everything in ETH okay  because it's a lot easier first let's say I’m   going to stake 100 ETH on this or let’s say I’m  going to stake 10 ETH on AAVE protocol because  
12:04
I think it's secure I’ve done the checks I’ve done  the audits there's no bugs and nothing will happen  
12:10
in the next 30 days because the code doesn't  change in the next 30 days there's no upgrades   and everything so I think it's secure I’m going  to stake 10 ETH to validate that this protocol is  
12:26
secure there is no bugs and everything  now because there's 10 ETH in the pool   then the member like me can come in to  say that oh there’s 10 ETH available so  
12:36
I can purchase you know I can buy the cover and  just in case anything happens that risk that  
12:42
risk assessor that amount of money the pool can  be used to pay out for my borrowing and lending  
12:48
of on AAVE that's why I buy the insurance right  okay so that's the that's the general idea and  
12:54
what about claim assessors so risk assessors are  like step one in the game right step one to look   at this protocols and say okay this is risky this  is not so risky they're not risky one I’m gonna  
13:04
put money on that the risky one I’m not gonna  put my money on there because someone's gonna   claim it and I’m gonna lose my stake then step  two is a member coming in and say oh I’m gonna  
13:13
use the protocol and I want to get insurance for  it because I’m worried and you buy the insurance  
13:18
now step three it's what happens when things  go wrong what happens where you actually need   something went wrong there's a bug in the code  and you need to get smart con you need you need  
13:28
the insurance cover that's the entire point of  buying insurance to cover your losses and that's  
13:34
where the third participant comes in they call  it the claims assessor as you can imagine they   assess the claim so they look at the claims  what you said and they will have a verdict  
13:47
the verdict is either yes or no and because right  now Nexus Mutual only covers a very specific niche  
13:55
risk which is the internal technical risk of  the protocol which means like a bug in the smart  
14:02
contract so it's a technical bug not an exploit  a bug a technical bug is that there's something  
14:08
wrong with the smart contract and as a result  you as a member or me as a member who bought   the insurance has to suffer the loss so that's  what they cover however if the system is not a  
14:19
bug it's like a maybe it's a technical risk from  an external system or I mean one day electricity  
14:28
shut off and you just can't use your system or  you can't use any of the protocols or there's a  
14:34
fault in the Ethereum network in general and all  the all the entire protocols don't work that's  
14:40
something they do not cover or if someone  else if a hacker is exploiting the system   through you know human exploit or governance  exploit or whatever other exploit but not smart  
14:51
contract exploit that the insurance doesn't  cover for that so you know insurance is very  
14:56
specific right so that is something specific they  cover now we can use machines to determine that  
15:04
but we can't just only rely on machines  because using asking machines to verify   if machines aren't mistaken or not you know it's  a bit difficult to do so that's where humans come  
15:13
in and these are claim assessors and to be a  claim assessor you have to stake your tokens  
15:18
and to be a claim assessor and then you vote yes  this is an error and we need to pay out like Nexus  
15:26
Mutual need to pay out or no this is not something  that Nexus Mutual covers this is like a governance  
15:32
exploit so we can't the insurance doesn't cover  that so no so that's what they do yes or no so  
15:38
that's the general idea of how Nexus Mutual work  and if you want to go a bit deeper when a member  
15:45
pays when a member buys a cover you know that  money is just gone you can claim the money back  
15:52
when there's an exploit and then you just claim  the amount of money that your insurance covers  
15:57
and then 50% of it of the cover price goes to  the staking reward for risk assessors so what  
16:07
happens when things go if nothing goes wrong so  the claim assesses are not involved it's just a  
16:13
member and a risk assessor so let's say I purchase  my costs I’m purchasing a 0.5 ETH of insurance and  
16:20
nothing goes wrong for the 20 days that I’m using  AAVE and so the 0.5 ETH goes into the reward pool  
16:28
and 50% of it so 0.25 ETH will be given to the  risk assessors and they will be split by all the  
16:35
different risk assessors it's not just one risk  assessor that enticing is distribution right so I   don't know you have like 20 100 risk assessors and  then all the different members that purchase the  
16:46
cover like part of it goes to the different all  the different risk assessors if nothing goes wrong  
16:52
and then you know the rest of the cover price  goes to other places we're going to talk about   it later and what happens when something  goes wrong so when something goes wrong  
17:01
the money that the risk assessor puts you know  their stake you know they don't get the stake   back anymore the stake be used to be refunding  the members and the claim assessors will come  
17:11
in and they will stake their NXM token and  they will vote yes or no and depending on that  
17:17
they will get returns they will get rewards  in NXM tokens and that's the general idea  
17:25
okay we're going to go a little bit deeper into  later much later on but this gives you a better  
17:31
scope to start understanding how Nexus Mutual  works what are the different participants how do  
17:37
we align the incentives because the entire thing  about insurance is how do you align the incentives  
17:42
between your principal and your agent and how do  you make sure that they work hand in hand so that   nobody exploits the system that is a detriment  to another person so how do we align that
17:55
so that in general is how it works and so how do  you use the token there is a token called the NXM  
18:02
token how do you use the token where is it being  used in general it's used in four systems the  
18:07
first one is to buy cover so remember as a member  I can purchase cover of the thing that I want to  
18:13
get insurance for and I can purchase it using NXM  tokens then as a risk assessor you know the guy  
18:21
who comes in and say that okay I’ve done the check  on the smart contract no bugs I’m going to put  
18:28
my stakes on there I’m going to put my money where  my mouth is and say that there's no bug it's safe   you can stake with NXM tokens and then for claim  assessors as well I come in to be a claim assessor  
18:41
to say that yes this smart contract as a bug  exploit versus this smart contract is a governor's  
18:46
exploit that we don't cover so to be a claim  assessor I have to stake my NXM tokens as well  
18:52
and lastly is governance so if there's any  governance required task like if you want to  
19:00
vote on improvement proposals then you stake your  NXM token as well or at least that's where NXM   token is used and it can use to be voting so these  are the four general use cases of NXM token okay  
19:13
so that's the general stuff now we're gonna dive  deeper into the nitty-gritty part of it which I   think is super exciting and as always we go back  to the fundamentals we go back to the framework  
19:24
that is being used to design these kind  of ecosystems with three different pillars   you've got market design mechanism design and  token design market design is the design of the  
19:33
environment which your participants will interact  with your participants and tokens will trade with   each other will transact with each other and we're  going to look at the thickness of the market how  
19:43
do we reduce congestion how do we increase safety  and ease of use for people but in general that's   the market we're going to design the what is the  environment which users or participants and the  
19:54
tokens will interact then we're going to look  at mechanism design mechanism design the rules  
19:59
of the game so it's the opposite of game theory  game theory is when something happens and you do  
20:04
a game theory analysis of the outcome and why  is it at this outcome based on the different  
20:10
strategies and incentives and payoffs mechanism  design is saying that this is the outcome that I  
20:16
want these are the behaviors that I want to  incentivize to get to this outcome so what   are the rules that I have in place so that people  will behave right to get the outcome that we want  
20:26
and this outcome is usually social optimizing so  everyone gets to benefit that's the entire point   so what kind of rules can I put in place and  we're going to look at things like governance  
20:34
non-financial incentives and the different kind  of structures and lastly we're going to look at  
20:40
token design token design is a pillar on its own  because sometimes it's needed sometimes it's not  
20:45
it's needed when we're looking at using tokens  as an incentive to alter the behaviors right  
20:51
in mechanism design we say that this is an  outcome that we want these are the behaviors   that we want to incentivize how do we incentivize  that we incentivize via tokens and that's where  
21:01
token design comes in but sometimes if you're  looking at some form of enterprise solution  
21:06
that's a very like a permissioned consortium  of participants and you don't need tokens to  
21:12
incentivize different behaviors then you don't  have to look at token design pillar at all  
21:17
but in Nexus Mutual we're looking at you know a  pretty decentralized ecosystem we're looking at a  
21:23
lot of people coming in from different backgrounds  so we have to look at tokens as the value incurred  
21:28
in the entire ecosystem and how do we incentivize  different participants and the ecosystem so that's  
21:34
where token design is important and we're going  to talk about it in Nexus Mutual's example and  
21:40
in token design we're going to look at stuff like  token policy financial incentives and architecture  
21:47
so let's get started with market design  the thing about the entire market thickness  
21:52
so market thickness is like level of  adoption of the market the thing about  
21:58
insurance especially Defi insurance is that it's  very related to the adoption of Defi in general  
22:05
so first you have adoption of crypto and then you  have adoption of Defi and then you have adoption  
22:10
of insurance and Defi because insurance it doesn't  make sense to have insurance without the market  
22:17
itself right so the market is Defi so if we look  at this is a graph by Defi pulse and in the past  
22:24
90 days 3 months you can see a steady increase in  the market adoption of Defi and if you look at the  
22:31
one year chart or you know a chart for three years  you can see that there is a steady increase in the  
22:36
market adoption of Defi which is a good thing and  the thing is Nexus Mutual scales together as the  
22:43
entire Defi market scales so it's very dependent  on the Defi adoption the Defi market adoption  
22:51
the reason why we're hearing about Defi or the  reason why we're hearing so much about Nexus  
22:56
today is that the Defi market is maturing a  little bit more every day I mean it's still quite  
23:03
immature but it's maturing a little bit more every  day and as it continuously matures as we have new  
23:09
participants coming in as we have different  types of risk-averse participants coming in   they are also demanding insurance so it's  almost like you could see that the rise of  
23:21
Defi market very correlated to the rise of demand  for insurance and the demand for Nexus Mutual  
23:28
hence the demand for the Nexus Mutual’s token  so that's in general how you get thickness of  
23:34
the market without it's like a chicken and egg  thing right if you don't have the market maturity  
23:41
or market adoption for Defi then it's going to  be very difficult to scale Nexus Mutual or it's  
23:48
very difficult to reach market thickness because  it's really dependent on the market size of Defi  
23:56
and when we look at creating market thickness  how do we increase the participants or increase  
24:01
the network of users in the system we look at a  few ways so the first one is a B2B market weight  
24:08
so B2B market is where you know Nexus Mutual  provides insurance and sometimes this insurance  
24:16
is not enough to provide insurance just for users  but other protocols could also tap into this thing  
24:24
so currently we have two there are two systems  that kind of like white label Nexus Mutual  
24:33
insurance to be reselling it in a different way  to its users or to its network so the first one is  
24:42
yinsure so if you heard of YFI or yearn platform  you know it's a really great platform it looks at  
24:48
a lot of different products and trying to allow  mass adoption for in a very seamless manner  
24:54
so if I don't want to be putting a lot of if I  don't want to be actively trading but I still   want to get you know the different returns that  is available in the market then I can go into  
25:04
the yearn platform and look at the different  systems in place and place my money there so  
25:10
that's in general you know the yearn thing and  that’s not enough they also want to look at  
25:17
insurance because yes I give you exposure to all  these different returns in the market very good  
25:23
but I also want to protect you from the risk so  that's where yinsure comes in what yinsure does is   that it takes the insurance cover that's provided  by NXM by Nexus Mutual and then it turns it into  
25:35
an NFT they white label this insurance and  then sells it in its ecosystem so that you as  
25:43
a person in as a user of the yearn platform I can  purchase the insurance the y insurance coverage  
25:53
so sounds confusing the way to break it down is  you know how insurance is you know in general  
26:00
insurance are provided by big companies right so  let's say I’m an insurance company and I’m going  
26:05
to provide travel insurance in general this  is the travel insurance I’m going to provide   now what some smaller insurance companies what  they do is that they will purchase insurance the  
26:16
general insurance from me and then they will  you know either customize it a bit or change  
26:22
some aspect and then resell it to other people  that's a very specialized niche so in general  
26:27
that's kind of what it does because the insurance  that's provided by yinsure it's only very specific  
26:34
coverage for the yearn platform so that's the  difference oh that’s more like the similarity so  
26:43
NXM is like the big boss that provides insurance  and then these other companies can purchase  
26:49
insurance the insurance cover from Nexus Mutual  and then they repackage it that to customize it  
26:55
to their platform and provide that insurance to  people in their ecosystem so that's in general  
27:02
how the yinsure works then you have a different  type of insurance it's called Cover protocol  
27:08
anyway all these things that I’m talking about  it's not investment advice and do your own  
27:15
research before you use them that's all I’m gonna  say so there's one called a Cover protocol they  
27:21
are trying to do a peer-to-peer coverage market  they also white label the insurance models or   the insurance that's provide insurance cover it's  provided by Nexus Mutual and they resell it to the  
27:31
market so that's the Cover protocol it used to be  called Safe and they renamed it to be called Cover  
27:39
and you can check them out Google them and  you can learn a bit more about what they do  
27:45
then the other method of B2B market so B2B markets  how do you scale right how do you scale the  
27:50
use the users of NXM or the users of Nexus  Mutual so those are more of the white label  
27:56
mechanism like B2B stuff there's another type  called shield mining which just started and  
28:02
that's why it took a little bit longer time  to create this video because it's doing a bit   of research in that what shield mining does is  that other than getting NXM tokens in returns  
28:11
you also get a native token from a different  protocol so if I’m covering for Lisa protocol  
28:17
then or if there's a Lisa protocol that is  available then as a risk assessor I will stake  
28:24
my NXM and if any if nothing happens then I will  get NXM back and I get Lisa tokens back and this  
28:30
Lisa tokens are provided by the Lisa protocol  so that's something that just started and there  
28:36
is one system in place right now or one protocol  in place and I think soon it was scaled to   quite big so that's a one of a B2B marketing  B2B market thickness kind of design or mechanism
28:52
so the B2C is how do you increase the different  users by having them participate in the various  
28:59
roles so remember there are four functions of  using an NXM token you have the member being  
29:06
to buy cover then you can be a risk assessor you  can be a claims assessor and you can participate   in governance so for all these different roles  you've got participants in there that's how they  
29:15
participate in the roles so the first one is the  user or the member they'll be purchasing covers  
29:21
and then you have the risk assessor you  have the claims assessor and then you have   people who want to participate in all these  governance votes so these are four different B2C  
29:31
kind of participant roles and there are ways to  increase their participation you know with users  
29:37
or members you want them to be purchasing more  insurance covers and as Defi continues to grow  
29:42
as new people are coming into the system that's  how you have new users as well for risk assessor  
29:48
for claims assessors as you have more protocols in  place then you have more of these risk assessors  
29:53
to be assessing the different smart contract  risks and then for governance as well   you can there's a lot of improvement proposals  out there so that's where the governance  
30:06
role will kick in and people be voting it's like  a time weighted or stake weighted vote and that's  
30:11
how you increase purchase participation from a  B2C level so a more like a peer-to-peer level  
30:18
so that's for market design you  know it's still very general   still quite easy to understand now we move on to  mechanism design remember mechanism design is the  
30:29
rules of the game so we're going to talk about  governance we're going to talk about decision   making we're going to talk about resolution  gonna talk about non-financial incentives
30:40
governance is really interesting  so there's two ways of decision  
30:46
in governance we have decision making our  first part of governance is decision making  
30:52
and the first part to do it is through incentive  improvement proposals so IP and you've got your  
31:00
Nexus Mutual improvement proposals so the one that  just passed today or yesterday and a few hours ago  
31:07
is this one by suggested by Yan from Delphi  Digital and it says to pause the daily 1% MCR  
31:15
growth we're going to talk about that later but  what it does is that basically anyone because it's  
31:20
all peer-to-peer right so anyone can participate  in anyone can propose something so the proposal  
31:26
is to is to pause the 1% MCR growth which  is something that's embedded in the system  
31:31
so the proposal is to pause that then he wrote a  proposal out and then the proposal will go into  
31:38
your governance role your governance vote so the  proposal is created by anyone could be you and me  
31:44
and then if it's approved it goes to governance  and in governance people will stake their tokens  
31:49
to see if I vote yes or no to this change  to this proposal change and the results  
31:56
in the past few hours or like 24 hours ago is  that people stake their tokens and say yes we   want to we want this proposal to be executed so  this is what is going to be executed right now  
32:09
and to execute this improvement proposal  so that's where decision making comes in  
32:15
and this is a human level decision making right  humans get to vote yes or no to these changes  
32:24
so this is good the other way where decision  making is made so this the improvement proposal  
32:29
is a more like a high level entire protocol  improvement proposal the other way to look  
32:35
at decision making is a more micro level a lower  level which is where you are assessing your claims  
32:41
so if there is a bug in a smart contract  if there is an error in the smart contract   then this is where the claim assessors come in  now there are two ways where decision making  
32:50
is being made one is automated and one is not  automated which is the human aspect the thing  
32:56
is we can't fully always rely on machines because  sometimes machines are wrong but we also want to   see how can we optimize the human participation  by getting more information given by machines  
33:08
so this is what is happening here in the claims  assessors aspect with machines we're using oracles  
33:15
so oracles to be fitting information in so that  humans don't have to Google what's the information  
33:20
what's the different details all the information  is provided by oracles and then humans will be the  
33:27
one deciding yes or no remember claim assessors  basically what they do is they stake their NXM  
33:33
tokens and say yes or no to should we return  or should we accept this claim and return the  
33:41
losses that's what claim assessors do and this  is crowdsourced by all the different participants  
33:47
which are all the various claim assessors so this  is how governance decision making is made in Nexus  
33:54
Mutual and what about resolution the thing is a  lot of times we are thinking about governance as  
34:00
in decision making how do we make a decision how  do we decide how do we vote it's all very good  
34:07
at the same time you have to remember what happens  when this governance thing goes wrong how do we  
34:12
resolve that and that's why that's something  that I think is very it's quite important a bit  
34:17
not many people are thinking so much about it  maybe it's not the right time yet but this is   something important to consider how do we resolve  when governance goes wrong and this is where  
34:28
Nexus Mutual thought about it and they have an  advisory board so the advisory board are you know  
34:34
not everyone gets to be part of the advisory board  you know these are people who are experts who have   experience who actually understand everything  that's going on and they can do three things  
34:43
the first one is to punish bad actors so you know  we go back to claim assessors claim assessors  
34:48
you've got the machine part which is the oracles  and they've got human part which is the thing   that's crowdsourced and sometimes you know as  much as we want to think that humans are good  
34:59
sometimes some humans are not so good they're  quite bad so this is where the advisory board  
35:05
comes in and if you're a bad person by doing a  bad decision that is a fraudulent decision that is  
35:12
a very negative decision that will affect  everyone then the advisory board will come   in to assess if you're a bad person or not so a  bad actor or not and if you're a bad actor your  
35:21
tokens will be burnt simple as that so this  is how it works as well so the advisory board  
35:27
can has the power to punish bad actors the second  thing is they can implement emergency pauses  
35:36
so you know if the stock market crash or  if the Defi market crashes or if there's  
35:41
something some issue that's go that's going on  that's external to the Nexus Mutual platform  
35:49
and it's an emergency something really bad happens  the advisory board can come in and implement an  
35:55
emergency pause like we're gonna stop we're gonna  post all activities right now we're gonna see  
36:00
what things are doing or how things are happening  and this is important because this also works in  
36:08
the real world this physical world so in the  stock market if the prices of you know if the S&P  
36:15
thing falls too much then the system will pause  automatically for 15 minutes for traders to gather  
36:23
their thoughts again and then the market will open  again you can start trading so something similar   instead of machines defining when to pause the  advisory board can implement the emergency pause  
36:35
and lastly they can vote on proposals if required  so yeah the proposal be you know for example this  
36:43
one that I mentioned the daily pause of 1% MCR  growth if there isn't enough people to be voting  
36:50
or if it's very technical that regular people  don't really understand or regular users  
36:56
you need a bit more knowledge to be understanding  if that proposal is a good or bad proposal then  
37:02
you know the advisory board can come in to be  voting on those proposals now the other part of  
37:09
resolution is what happens when the contracts blow  up so as a member you can buy these covers and  
37:16
what happens when the smart contract has an error  has a bug and I need to submit my claim to get  
37:26
covers for my losses so what happens firstly me  as a member I’ve got cover for this Lisa protocol  
37:33
and this Lisa protocol is full of bugs and I want  to get cover for it so I go and submit my claim  
37:42
to the Nexus Mutual system and this is where a  claim assessor will come in and the claim assessor  
37:48
will see okay the smart contract I’ll see okay  and I will vote if this is a bug or if this is  
37:55
some other exploit and so I’ll be voting  on it and then it'd be a weighted vote  
38:01
and for it to approve as this is about I need  to get 70% of all the different risk assessors  
38:07
or claim assessors together to say yes this is a  bug you will get your refund and if I don't get  
38:14
if there isn't enough claim assessors then  everyone in the membership everyone who owns  
38:20
NXM token has to vote but basically that's  the idea so if 70% says yes this is a bug  
38:26
you will get your coverage then you get your  coverage if 70% says no this is an exploit by  
38:31
someone else that is like a governance exploit  that has nothing got to do with the bug then me   as a member I don't get a claim or I don't get  any coverage and so this is where the claim the  
38:45
claimant says is just do one thing just answers  one thing is this an exploit or is this a bug and  
38:51
all you have to do is say yes or no and then you  get your coverage or you don't get your coverage  
38:59
so that is the general idea  of how everything works   for non-financial incentives we're going to look  at truthful voting is a very delicate subject as  
39:09
you can imagine the US elections is coming up  and everyone's talking a lot about voting is a   very delicate subject but right now it's good that  we're more in a closed-loop system in Nexus Mutual  
39:20
and we can look at how do we align incentives of  the different agents to get the truth out through  
39:27
voting and we talked about this previously in the  last episode about principal agent misalignment  
39:35
or incentive misalignment and maybe in Nexus  Mutual that can be resolved with tokens so using  
39:42
tokens as a way to incentivize behaviors so that  we can align incentives for the principal and  
39:47
agent so the principal and agent will be the risk  assessors and the members who bought the covers  
39:54
so how does it work firstly the claim  assessor has to stake some NXM tokens  
40:00
then the behavior is to either  vote yes or no for the claims  
40:08
then the advisory board will determine if the  behavior of these assessors so the assessors  
40:14
will determine the behavior of the smart  contract and then the advisory board would   determine the behavior of these risk assessors  if they are behaving well it's all fine and good  
40:25
then they will get some tokens back as  return as a reward for participating  
40:30
but if they behave badly then their tokens  will be burnt or the tokens will be locked up  
40:36
so that's where you know the claim assessors  get a share of the fee or you know if you're  
40:41
making a good decision then you get share of it  you get some fees or you get some tokens extra  
40:46
tokens if you behave badly then your tokens will  be locked up for a while so you can't use the  
40:53
tokens but you still have the tokens there's like  a punishment so to incentivize you to behave well  
40:58
and if you behave fraudulently so you are  cheating then your tokens will be burnt and one  
41:06
other thing to align incentives is that there's a  12 hour cooling off period for claim assessors so  
41:14
if I’m assessing the claim for AAVE protocol  then I can't assess another protocols claim  
41:21
for 12 hours and this is quite important this is  quite useful because you don't want people to be  
41:28
assessing claims for a lot of different protocols  at once and then they keep saying yes to everyone   and they try to exploit the system so there's  a 12 hour cooling off period so there's a 12  
41:37
hour break between the next kind of risk that  I can a next smart contract that I can assess
41:46
so a quick snapshot that is done by Nexus Mutual  the little flow is that first you have a claim  
41:52
submission and the claim assessors will determine  yes you get a claim or no you don't get a claim if  
41:58
majority says yes then it is whatever the outcome  is if less than 70% comes to a common consensus  
42:07
then all the members has to vote and then whatever  the outcome is it's either yes or no and then  
42:16
the used claims assess a vote yeah will be will  be voted by majority so there are two layers  
42:25
of voting the first layer is in general these  claim assessors they would decide yes or no 70%  
42:31
if 70% says yes then whatever  the outcome is if less than 70%   agrees on anything then all the members have  to vote and the outcome will be whatever the  
42:39
outcome is whatever the majority says is  yes or no so that's the mechanism design  
42:47
and now let's look deeper into the token design  I think the token design part is really exciting  
42:53
once again we're going to look at it token  design pillar we're going to look at we're   gonna specifically look at the token policy so the  monetary policy of the NXM token the valuation of  
43:03
NXM token and then we're also going to look at  financial incentives so the platform activities   and the ROI or returns to stake for the NXM token  a very high level summary of the NXM token so  
43:17
the value of it is determined through a continuous  token model and as you can imagine we're using a  
43:24
token bonding curve so the cool difference but  I talk a lot about token bonding curve right  
43:31
and I feel like that’s the only thing I talk about  but I can talk a lot more about token bonding   the difference between token  bonding curve if you look behind
43:42
so the AMM token bonding curve that  we have been talking a lot about is  
43:48
the AMM type which is however NXM's bonding  curve is quite different which is this one
44:00
they're almost like a mirror image of each  other and there's nothing wrong with it because   the shape of the curve is not doesn't the shape  of the curve is not fixed you know should it be  
44:10
concave upwards concave downwards convex upwards  convex downwards doesn't matter because bonding  
44:16
curve is just a way a representation of how two  variables are interacting with each other so in  
44:22
general this is the shape of the bonding curve for  NXM versus AMM and it's quite important for you to  
44:30
conceptualize the difference because for AMM  it's a different kind of model that's why the  
44:37
curve is like that and NXM is a yeah a different  model from AMMs that's why the curve is like that  
44:44
so it's quite different however the concept is  the same the concept is just a bonding curve okay  
44:50
and how price is determined so with  AMMs price is determined this way
45:11
with AMMs your price of asset 1 is will  give you the price of asset two so if I’m  
45:19
swapping like Lisa tokens to get ETH for example  that's where the AMM model works like that the  
45:26
bonding curve for Nexus Mutual is like slightly  different so we have price on one side as well
45:48
so the price is determined by this curve and  this curve the q here I’m talking about is the  
45:55
quantity of capital and the capital which  is the funding level of this entire system  
46:02
so to make it a bit simpler the price of NXM  token the p star you see on NXM is related  
46:09
to or it's a function or it's you know subjected  to the amount of capital that is being input  
46:14
into the system so quite simple  as more capital is in there
46:33
as more capital is input into the NXM system  the p the value of token of NXM increases so  
46:42
that's the general idea we're going to go into the  details later but this is the high level summary   of how the token bonding curve or how the bonding  curve is very different from AMM versus NXM
46:55
and before I dive into NXM I just want to  have this thing quick quickly out of the way  
47:01
the difference between NXM versus Wrapped  NXM as I mentioned earlier in the video  
47:07
NXM is where your price is determined via the  bonding curve so there's a function of the  
47:14
as the capital increases then  the value of your token increases   or the price of the token increases whereas  Wrapped NXM is really dependent on trade  
47:25
like it's dependent on almost like speculation  because Wrapped NXM technically gives you  
47:32
a chance to redeem one Wrapped NXM for  one NXM by one of these NXM members  
47:39
but the value like the real Wrapped NXM value is  still quite subjected to speculation and trading  
47:48
which is completely fine so what I’m trying  to say is that the way to get the value of NXM  
47:53
is fixed with math the way to get the value of  Wrapped NXM is not fixed it's quite dependent  
48:00
on speculation and trade so let's get that  out of the way and everything else for the  
48:05
rest of this video is talking about NXM itself  Wrapped NXM is determined by a lot of other  
48:10
secondary market and trading and let's  not talk about it let's focus on NXM  
48:16
so we get started with the monetary policy  with NXM there are two functions in the  
48:23
math that we want to talk about and as you  can see this model this formula over here
48:38
now that is the formula for determining  the price of a NXM token and there are two  
48:46
variables in there so there are two variables  that's fixed and two variables that's flexible  
48:52
and I’m going to circle the fixed one out  and I’m going to underline the variables out
49:04
so you could see that a and c are fixed variables   and we're going to dive into that a bit deeper  anyway and then the thing that changes is the MCR  
49:17
and this other thing called the  total capital or capital pool   these two variables are important because what  do they signify if we look at MCR MCR is kind  
49:27
of like the reserve in a bank have you heard of  fractional reserve so if I put a $100 in my bank  
49:34
the bank will by some laws of the government is  changing a bit in 2020 but let's just say that  
49:41
the government says that you have to take 20% of  your deposit the bank has to take 20% of deposits  
49:48
and put it in the bank as a reserve so if I put  $100 in the bank $20 will be in the reserve that  
49:54
the company the bank cannot touch and the rest of  the $80 can be used to be lent out to other people  
50:01
so that's fractional banking this fractional  reserve NXM does something similar so if I put  
50:06
a $100 100 ETH as capital into the NXM pool part  of it has to go to reserve and the other part  
50:14
is available so that's the general idea and that's  what MCR is MCR is the minimum capital requirement  
50:21
it's kind of like the reserve in the bank the  second part is the total capital or the capital   pool and if you want just now we talk about market  design and how NXM is quite related to the Defi  
50:35
market growth or the Defi growth so the total  capital increase you can think about it as the  
50:42
increase in Defi adoption or Defi market adoption  Defi protocol adoption so as more Defi protocols  
50:50
are being adopted you can argue that there's a  correlation to an increase in the total capital  
50:56
so these are two variables that is included or  there is involved in this model and this is very  
51:02
important why because MCR so the result in the  bank is like a short-term forecast or short-term  
51:11
variable to understanding the  growth of Nexus Mutual's protocol  
51:17
whereas the total capital this variable  is a way to look at the long-term growth  
51:24
of Nexus Mutual really cool right because we're  looking at this formula where it involves both  
51:32
short-term variable and long-term variable  again short-term variable because these are  
51:40
amount of money or reserve that you could  use to do your insurance cover whereas the  
51:46
long-term growth is the total capital which  is linked to Defi adoption how cool is that  
51:52
and because of that we're gonna look at three  elements in the token in the bonding curve the  
51:58
first one as you can imagine is the total capital  the second is the MCR so the capital requirement  
52:04
and this capital inquire requirements is important  so in case anything happens this insurance cover  
52:11
this insurance it can this minimum  capital can be used to cover the insurance  
52:16
and lastly it's the MCR ratio so the ratio  because we only have two variables right the  
52:22
MCR and the total capital so the MCR ratio is  the MCR no it's the total capital divided by MCR  
52:31
so the linking between these two variables so  MCR is the short-term growth total capital is  
52:38
the long-term growth and then we're going to  look at the inter-relation with them and then   we have these three different variables added  into the model so that the model can give us  
52:45
a more robust understanding of the entire  ecosystem through the price of NXM token  
52:54
make sense the price of NXM token it's very cool  because it's not only just giving you the value of  
53:03
what NXM that the system does but it also takes in  the short-term growth the long-term growth and the  
53:11
relationship between the short-term and long-term  growth and that's why NXM is very interesting
53:19
let's look a little bit  deeper at the bonding curve   as I mentioned this is the formula so the  pricing everything is based on Ether so the  
53:30
price of the NXM token is a which is a and c are  fixed amount and then the MCR MCR also pricing ETH  
53:39
it's the minimum amount of capital required to  cover the existing covers and we're looking at  
53:53
the minimum capital requirement  you could use 100% of the capital   that is added into the system to be used as the  minimum capital requirement so that people can be  
54:06
always covered right you're always assured but  at the same time if you think about it that's  
54:11
quite inefficient use of capital because  this capital is I know it's insurance right  
54:18
and the thing about insurance  is that everything you insure   it doesn't always happen like the bad things  don't always happen so you just buy insurance as a  
54:29
as a hedge and if these things don't happen  but you still have your capital sitting there  
54:36
just preparing in case these bad things happen  so that insurance the capital could cover it  
54:41
then it's a very inefficient use of capital so  they've done some calculations to see what's the  
54:49
probability of bad things happening so what's the  minimum capital required to cover these bad things  
54:55
like this minimum level of bad things so we  call them the minimum capital requirement   MCR and then you have your MCR percentage ratio  so that is the capital pool divided by the MCR so  
55:10
the capital pool is the total amount collaterals  in the pool if you think about it if you are very  
55:16
comfortable with AMMs and decentralized exchange  capital pool is kind of like a liquidity provider  
55:22
you have this big pool and then you just provide  your capital inside and in AMMs that's where  
55:29
people can be swapping and trading and doing your  exchange similar concept where you have a big pool  
55:36
and then you put ETH in there to get your  NXM token out so it's a yeah it's a similar  
55:43
concept so that's what total capital is total  capital is something like a liquidity provider  
55:49
a liquidity pool then the capital requirement  is the amount of the minimum amount of money  
55:55
required to pay the claims you know let's say 1%  of all the claims are defaulted and you have to  
56:02
payout and that is what the capital the minimum  capital requirement is that's how you get it  
56:09
and the ratio is capital efficiency it shows  capital efficiency so you have the capital divided  
56:14
by the total capital divided by the requirement  so it's how efficient your capital is being used  
56:22
remember if I take 100% of the capital and or the  total capital and I store in in my safe so just in  
56:32
case anything any bad thing happens then we we're  always assured that there is enough money to repay  
56:37
that's good right but if nothing happens and  you know that you're 99% sure that out of this  
56:47
100 ETH that's in the pool 0.001% is going to be  pretty safe oh it's going to be really safe and  
56:58
so we want to take this you know 0.001 ETH out and  use it somewhere else so maybe we can use it in  
57:05
other kind of system to be getting returns  and that is efficiently employing capital  
57:13
we talked about this in the one of the first few  slides in a previous video of how insurance is  
57:19
such a big market because they aggregate risk from  everyone but the thing is not everything like not  
57:26
all the bad things that they cover in insurance  will happen so then they but they have this pool  
57:32
of capital available because people are buying  risk right and some people are super risk averse   so people will be paying more and because of that  insurance companies can use this funds available  
57:43
this capital available and reinvest it somewhere  else so that they can be earning more money  
57:48
and this is why the MCR ratio is quite important  because it talks about capital efficiency  
57:53
how efficiently is capital being  used and deployed in the system
57:58
and now I want to dive a little bit deeper into  understanding the changes in monetary policy  
58:05
there's seven questions that we want to answer  the first one is how does the graph move
58:12
how do we change the shape of the graph  what happens when the capital pool increases   what happens when more cover is being purchased  what is a dynamic capital floor which is something  
58:23
that they have created what why do we want  to increase the MCR ratio so as Nexus started  
58:31
they increased the MCR by 1% every single day and  why is that done and also why is the improvement  
58:40
proposal that was just approved about 24 hours  ago why did they want to stop this 1% MCR growth  
58:47
so these all these questions are related  to the monetary policy or the token policy   of NXM and I want to answer them so let's start  with the graph part okay two things how does  
59:00
the graph move and how do you change the shape of  the graph so I’ve done a little graphing out here  
59:09
and this is your model I didn't name  them properly so sorry about that  
59:16
basically the c is correct the b actually  represents a in the model and a represents the MCR  
59:26
so what I’m graphing over here technically the  entire model of Nexus Mutual is a 3D graph because  
59:33
you have three variables the first variable is  your token price the second variable is the MCR  
59:38
and the third variable is total capital pool now  I’m just going to assume that the MCR is fixed so  
59:45
we're going to take a snapshot in time right now  things are fixed and what happens when the capital  
59:51
pool increases because the capital pool is a lot  easier to understand because as a user to increase  
59:58
the capital pool I basically put more money into  the system put more ETH into the system and then  
1:00:07
it changes so I just want to show you a  very quick understanding of how it works  
1:00:14
how does a change in the capital pool affect  the change in prices so the first question that  
1:00:20
we want to answer is how does the graph  move so how do you move along the graph  
1:00:26
let's take a snapshot of the system right now  and now nothing changes everything is on pause  
1:00:31
what can we understand from the graph  so if there is X amount of capital  
1:00:38
like the graph line shows that at X amount  of capital what would the token price be  
1:00:45
so if the capital increases then you  just find the go along the graph line  
1:00:53
and you realize that the cap the price of the  token of NXM token also increases that’s the  
1:00:58
idea so that's how the graph move so the way to  move the graph is to add more capital in there  
1:01:06
and increase the token price or if you remove  capital in there then you reduce your token price  
1:01:12
so how do we do that you can add more  capital so add more ETH to exchange NXM  
1:01:18
so you basically you're paying ETH to buy NXM  and each NXM you purchase is different price  
1:01:25
the price is determined by the bonding curve and  basically to determine how much it is to buy like  
1:01:33
100 NXM token you basically use the graph and then  figure out the area under the curve to determine  
1:01:38
the price that's how you get it and if you want  to reduce or go down along the line of along the  
1:01:48
graph then I will sell my NXM token and I can  redeem it for the capital that is the area under  
1:01:54
the graph as well so that's how it works that's  how things can move along the line of the graph
1:02:03
the second thing is how do we change the shape of  the graph so because this is really mapped to the  
1:02:08
price of token versus capital and you can see that  as I increase my capital as I increase the capital  
1:02:16
being put in then the graph also the shape of  the graph changes so as more and more capital is  
1:02:22
added into the system then the curve is a lot more  gentle which means the increase in one token being  
1:02:33
purchased or the token price of token one versus  token or token x plus token x plus n token x plus  
1:02:40
one the change in value is a bit less so it's  a bit more efficient but if I have very little  
1:02:48
capital then the graph is very steep that means if  the price difference between token x and token x  
1:02:57
plus one has a more significant difference so a  greater marginal difference so long story short  
1:03:05
more capital more gentle the curve which is  better for trade or better for pricing because  
1:03:11
the price of the next token is not that much  different than the price of the previous token  
1:03:17
so in general that's how the shape of the graph  changes now let's look at what happens when  
1:03:22
the capital pool increases and let's go to the  whiteboard and I’m just going to be writing it  
1:03:27
out and I’m going to be talking about it later  so what happens when capital pool increases
1:03:47
so when capital pool increases the x increases   as we can see that the x increases  the line becomes more gentle right
1:03:56
and if all things if all things  stay the same this is what
1:04:17
so if capital pool increases then the entire  thing of capital pool divided by MCR percentage  
1:04:24
times the power four increases and then the  entire thing increase the entire variable  
1:04:32
increases the multiplication variable increases  and so the price of token increases that's general  
1:04:42
concept what happens when the capital pool  increases now what happens when more cover is
1:04:48
purchased
1:04:58
so firstly when more cover is being purchased  your MCR increases right because as more cover  
1:05:04
is being purchased the minimum amount of money  you need increases so because you know that's  
1:05:10
the minimum capital required to cover this  this insurance being this cover being bought  
1:05:17
at the same time something else increases when I’m   adding money to buy cover I’m also  adding money into the capital right
1:05:31
the total capital pool also increases and so now  we have two variables we have MCR increasing and  
1:05:38
then we have the total capital pool increasing  and this is important to note because this part
1:05:48
the ratio of both of them it it's quite   important in determining the price of the token  so now we have to see which one increases more
1:06:02
and in general the total capital  pool actually increases more than   the minimum capital requirement and  if you just think about it intuitively  
1:06:11
the total the MCR is called the minimum capital  requirement and in general the minimum capital  
1:06:17
requirement is much lower than the total  capital pool so that helps you to conceptualize  
1:06:23
why total capital pool is more than  the minimum capital requirement
1:06:39
so similarly when so the cap pool increases  by two arrows and you know MCR just increased  
1:06:45
by one arrow in general the entire variable  increases and so p the price of token increases  
1:06:51
so what does it mean it means that as more people  purchase insurance the price of NXM increases  
1:06:59
and also yeah going back to the previous one as  well what happens when capital pool increases   as more people add money to the capital pool of  Nexus Mutual the price of NXM token increases
1:07:10
why what is the dynamic capital floor
1:07:18
so I added a dot on the graph and a much lower  end and it's called the dynamic capital floor  
1:07:26
as you can imagine what a capital floor  is that it's the minimum amount that it's  
1:07:33
needed there are two types of minimum  amount one is the MCR the which is the  
1:07:39
minimum capital required and the other  one is this capital floor which is the   least amount of capital needed in the system and  it's dynamic because it allows it changes based on  
1:07:51
the different variables that's in  there and this is important because   the dynamic capital floor is much it's lower than  the minimum capital requirements so just in case  
1:08:01
if things go bad if things go wrong you have  this variable there to allow the advisory board  
1:08:09
or allow people in the Nexus Mutual ecosystem to  understand that oh we are reaching very critically  
1:08:14
low volume and that could be one of the reasons  to create the emergency pause in the system
1:08:22
the next one is why do we  want to increase the MCR ratio
1:08:32
so what is the MCR ratio and  why does it need to increase
1:08:44
so currently the MCR ratio is more than 130%  and this is important because your total capital  
1:08:56
so the MCR is the minimum capital required and  so the ratio shows the total capital divided by  
1:09:03
the MCR so it's a lot more than the MCR so that  if MCR is where the minimum capital needed to  
1:09:12
cover these insurance covers and you want your  capital to be above that so just in case a lot of  
1:09:18
other bad things go wrong then you have enough  capital to be covering that so it's 130% and so  
1:09:23
previously they're always increasing the MCR ratio  so that by increasing the ratio means that you  
1:09:30
have more capital available to be covering the  MCR and this is in general a good thing if you  
1:09:36
think about it because remember we talked about  this ratio being the capital efficiency right  
1:09:48
so the MCR ratio shows how efficiently the capital  is being used and being deployed and if the cap if  
1:09:56
the ratio is very high it means that there's  a lot of capital available that is not being  
1:10:02
used as the reserve so that means we have a  lot of capital available to be used for other  
1:10:08
things like other kind of investment other kind of  funding other ways to get returns on your capital  
1:10:14
if the capital is very low it means that a  lot of these capital are being used for your  
1:10:19
minimum capital requirement which means being  used they're like stagnant it's a reserve just  
1:10:26
in case anything happens if you used to return to  the system and this is good because if we have the  
1:10:33
if the MCR ratio is higher that means capital can  be employed more efficiently and more robustly  
1:10:41
now what why does so then let's move on to  the last question why does the improvement  
1:10:47
proposal want to stop the 1% MCR growth so  I didn't talk about it just now but one of  
1:10:54
the things that is embedded in the system is  that for every 24 hours the MCR will grow by 1%
1:11:07
so in general anyway the MCR will keep growing  by 1% every 24 hours that’s the system that  
1:11:16
they created for Nexus Mutual and that's good  because the MCR is the minimum capital required  
1:11:23
and as more covers are being created then you  need to grow your MCR right it's good so every  
1:11:28
24 hours it will grow by 1% so any capital  that's being put in or any capital that's  
1:11:34
out there they would they will keep you know  siphoning out part of it to go into the reserve  
1:11:39
just in case there are covers needed and  that's where the capital will come from   and then there's this entire Defi boom so this in  this entire Defi boom a lot of people are buying  
1:11:49
covers and so what Nexus did was that okay so  many people are buying covers we need to increase  
1:11:55
our MCR so that if anything happens then there  is enough capital to be deployed and returned to  
1:12:01
be to be covering the losses of these insurance  covers right okay so what they did instead of  
1:12:06
every 24 hours they increase by 1% so that  every 4 hours they will increase by 1%  
1:12:11
so what does it mean if we look at the capital  efficiency again we are increasing MCR by 1%
1:12:18
right it means that our MCR ratio will drop so  previously I think one of the at one time the  
1:12:31
MCR ratio was 143% which is good efficient use  of capital right there's a lot more capital  
1:12:38
than it is for then the minimum capital  requirement to cover the losses so then you can  
1:12:44
use this capital efficiently and what they've done  now is to increase to grow the MCR a lot quicker  
1:12:52
which means it will reach back to the 130% so  to drop that MCR ratio and because there is more  
1:13:00
demand in the Defi ecosystem which is good but  this improvement proposal says that we should  
1:13:07
stop the MCR growth and answer is quite simple  because if we keep going back down to you know the  
1:13:14
MCR ratio is lower and lower it means that we're  using capital inefficiently because a lot of  
1:13:20
these capital can be used to do other things as I  mentioned to be funding to look at different kind  
1:13:25
of returns in different kind of protocols but  we are just keeping all of them in the reserve  
1:13:31
instead just in case something happens so that's  what they want to do so and that's why they want  
1:13:36
to stop the 1% insane growth for a while because  there's more than enough to cover the existing  
1:13:43
insurance covers for now these are various  examples of how monetary policy can be changed for  
1:13:50
the Nexus Mutual token and it's very it's super  exciting and fun because if you think about it  
1:13:55
number one the policies of the monetary policy the  math includes a lot of different like long-term  
1:14:00
short-term variables the mark the capital  efficiency or capital allocation efficiency   in the system and it has all these variables  into the math and then at the end of all  
1:14:09
these different variables it comes out a price  which is the Nexus Mutual price to tell you the  
1:14:15
risk or the value of the system good stuff then  the other thing is that people can just propose  
1:14:23
changes and other people will vote on it so this  is really what the entire Defi space is looking to  
1:14:29
do it's decentralized anyone can participate  anyone can vote and the prices of tokens  
1:14:37
are not because of speculation outside but because  the market or the ecosystem or this platform  
1:14:45
is robust and it adds a lot of it creates  a lot of value it aggregates future value  
1:14:52
and short-term value into it to give out prices  and from there as a regular user you don't know  
1:14:59
how to analyze all these different pricing of  different protocols so you see this token price  
1:15:05
as a way to understand the long-term  potential of these protocols and that's  
1:15:11
why I think it's super fascinating and  Nexus Mutual is doing it pretty well
1:15:19
so that's all for the token the  monetary policy part let's look   at the token supply so with the bonding curve  this is called a dynamic token supply because  
1:15:30
the supply of the token changes based on the  capital required right the capital inside  
1:15:37
and then the price is determined by  your math we can increase the price   through performing risk assessment performing  claim assessment participating in governance  
1:15:47
we can not increase the price increase the supply  of tokens by these doing these things because if  
1:15:54
you are part of risk assessment part of claim  assessment if you participate in governance you  
1:15:59
get additional NXM tokens so you stake your NXM  tokens and then you can get additional NXM tokens  
1:16:05
to decrease the supply and decreasing the supply  means the yeah to decrease the supply then you  
1:16:11
can the advisory board will burn fraudulent claims  so for a claim assessor when they stake their NXM  
1:16:18
token and people found out that they're bad actors  they're fraudulent actors then their tokens will  
1:16:23
be burned and when you burn your tokens then you  know the overall value of tokens actually increase  
1:16:31
the other way is also when you're purchasing  cover you can purchase covers in two ways   you can purchase an ETH or you can purchase using  NXM tokens right now they're only using these two  
1:16:41
these two tokens currencies to be purchasing  covers and when you use NXM tokens to purchase  
1:16:48
covers 90% of that will be burnt why because when  you burn these tokens then the remaining value  
1:16:55
of the tokens actually increase which is quite  cool and so that's how the token supply changes
1:17:05
and what about valuation again the valuation is  done by via the bonding curve and it's priced   in ETH and right now the math is whatever that  we saw on the whiteboard in the future they're  
1:17:17
going to look at you know FX exposure so in  the future you could look at other than ETH and  
1:17:25
NXM then you have other currencies available to  be purchasing and as the currency increases or  
1:17:33
decreases then you have different variables that  will be affecting the price of NXM token because  
1:17:38
NXM token is really an aggregator of everything  that's happening in the ecosystem on the Nexus   Mutual ecosystem and giving you a price and  value to show you what the risk or potential is  
1:17:50
then another thing that they're looking at in the  near future is this thing called a gearing factor   which will change a little bit of the math but  gearing factor is really how diversified their  
1:18:00
insurance cover is so for example if they're  only going to cover like landing protocols  
1:18:06
and 90% of all the insurance cover is only just  to cover AAVE then it's quite volatile because  
1:18:14
if AAVE has a bug and if 90% of the insurance  covers is only on AAVE then there's a lot to  
1:18:21
pay out and this would definitely destabilize the  Nexus Mutual ecosystem so this gearing factor that  
1:18:27
they talk about is a way to increase diversity  or diversification of the Nexus Mutual platform  
1:18:36
okay what about the financial incentives so  financial incentives we're going to look at   platform activities as I mentioned there are  four platform activities you can buy cover  
1:18:45
you can assess risk you can assess claim and you  can vote in governance so if you buy the cover  
1:18:52
then 90% of the NXM used to  buy the cover will be burned   and when you burn it when you burn the NXM then  the value of the remaining NXM increases and then  
1:19:02
10% of the NXM goes will be retained by the member  and goes to the collateral pool and this is when  
1:19:09
their money to be like there's rewards to be given  out then that's where it comes from the collateral  
1:19:16
pool the other one is to claim assessment so you  stake your Nexus Mutual to be voting on claims  
1:19:24
and if you vote with consensus so if you  vote alongside with 70% of the people and  
1:19:31
they all say like they'll say yes and you  vote yes and that's 70% percent of the   majority then you get more NXM tokens if you  vote against so if 70% say yes and you're the  
1:19:43
few that says no you used to keep your NXM  tokens just that it'd be locked up for a while  
1:19:48
so you can't use it for a while it's like  punishment for saying the wrong stuff   but you still own your NXM tokens you know however  if you vote fraudulently so if you vote badly if  
1:19:59
you're a bad actor no it's not that you're lying  on anything you're a bad actor then your tokens  
1:20:04
will be burnt and when your tokens will be burnt  then the overall value of the NXM token increases  
1:20:11
for risk assessors you stake you stake against  a smart contract so that's where you put your   NXM token there to stake you can also use  ETH and then when a cover is being purchased  
1:20:22
and you're and nothing goes wrong then you can  get some of the NXM tokens or you can get some  
1:20:30
amount of money that is given by these people who  purchase the cover and then if there is a claim  
1:20:39
then some of the stakes will be burnt so the NXM  that you stake some of them will be burnt you   will still keep some of them but some of them  will be burned it's almost like punishment for  
1:20:48
not auditing the smart contract well enough  to realize that there is a bug something like  
1:20:54
that you know something along the lines that's how  you use tokens to align incentives and lastly for  
1:21:02
lastly you've got governance and you can stake   your NXM token to be voting on  that and it be a weighted vote
1:21:10
so the other platform activity is that going  back to the bonding curve we are exchanging NXM  
1:21:18
for ETH so if we look at the curve there are  two variables right because bonding curve is  
1:21:26
all about interlinking two variables and the two  variables that we're interlinking is NXM and ETH
1:21:38
so in the curve we are linking two variables which  is the native token NXM and the capital pool which  
1:21:44
is defined in ETH and then that so that's the two  variables we want then the relationship is the  
1:21:50
math and that math is getting in the variables on  long-term and short-term potential of Nexus Mutual  
1:21:58
and then you link these two variables together  which is really cool and you could change it  
1:22:04
very easily by having changing the capital  or changing the MCR and you could change
1:22:14
yeah so you could change the shape of the  curve as we mentioned by having more capital  
1:22:21
or by having the capital floor that we talked  about the dynamic capital floor or having the   MCR which is the minimum capital requirement and  you could change the shape of the curve you can  
1:22:30
change how much NXM you can exchange for ETH how  much ETH you can exchange for NXM we're going to  
1:22:38
look at ROI risks so in financial incentives we  also look at ROI like returns to investment or  
1:22:44
returns to stake and the risks involved so one of  the risk as I mentioned was if in Nexus Mutual 90%  
1:22:52
of the insurance cover is used to cover AAVE just  one of these protocols or like the Lisa protocol  
1:22:58
so if 90% of it is to cover the Lisa protocol and  if the Lisa protocol has it's like super buggy and  
1:23:06
completely gone too like super shitty then  the Nexus Mutual will be very badly affected  
1:23:14
because a lot of them will be paying out to these  Lisa protocol so one thing to think about or one  
1:23:20
thing for them to do for them to realize is that  you need to diversify your risk diversifying your   risk as in having giving insurance covers to a  lot of different protocols different protocols  
1:23:34
different segments of protocols different  Defi categories Defi industries really want to  
1:23:41
diversify your risk and one way to do that is  having like a hard limit saying that you know  
1:23:48
in the in 100% of the funds available then I only  want to do like 10% maximum of this 100% available  
1:23:59
to be covering each protocol or to be  covering a segmented protocol so like  
1:24:04
AMMs or like decentralized exchanges only 10% of  the total capital that we have can be used to be  
1:24:12
covering these insurance for this  particular segment or this particular  
1:24:18
protocol so then it forces people to  diversify so you can increase your  
1:24:25
funds by putting more capital in and then you can  increase the exposure it's still hard limit of 10%  
1:24:31
but you can increase the amount of capital that is  directed to covering taxes and so that's one way  
1:24:37
hard limit the other way is to have a variable  right now they're calling it a gearing factor  
1:24:45
to diversify the risk to understand what is the  diversification level of the insurance covers  
1:24:55
so the higher the diversification risk the  better because as we diversify more then   we're less impacted when one of them goes  south so that's one way to do with the risk
1:25:07
and the other way to look at ROI is shield mining  I talked about just now so shield mining is when a  
1:25:14
protocol also comes in with Nexus Mutual so let's  go back to Lisa protocol and if I’m partnering or  
1:25:24
like if Lisa is partnering with Nexus Mutual  then for claim assessors when they stake  
1:25:30
on the Lisa protocol they will get NXM as returns  and not only that they can also get the Lisa token  
1:25:36
as returns so this is another incentive because  we want to incentivize people to stake more and  
1:25:42
this can help with mass adoption not just mass  adoption for Nexus Mutual but mass adoption for   Lisa protocol because number one more people get  access to Lisa's protocol to Lisa protocol because  
1:25:53
I get claims in the Lisa tokens secondly  it's also it's also another way to signal  
1:26:00
that these claim assessors are confident in the  Lisa protocol's future because not only do they  
1:26:06
get NXM in return they also get the Lisa token as  return and for me to want to demand Lisa token in  
1:26:12
return I am basically signalling to everyone  that I think there is a long-term future of  
1:26:18
the Lisa protocol and that's why I’m willing  to accept Lisa token as a different incentive  
1:26:25
there's a lot to wrap around so in general  number one other than the NXM token that I  
1:26:31
receive I can also receive the Lisa token number  two the claim assessor receiving Lisa token  
1:26:38
is a signal so we talked about signal in the  previous video it's a signal to tell everyone   else that I’ve got faith in this protocol not just  because I’m staking on it I’m staking my NXM on it  
1:26:49
but I’m also willing to receive Lisa tokens as  returns because I believe that there's a future  
1:26:54
of value to that and that's why I’m willing to  receive it right now so that's what that's the   economics of shield mining which is a very  interesting way to align incentives between  
1:27:04
the agent and principle which is the NXM the  yield the protocol itself the Lisa protocol  
1:27:12
and the the risk assessors so that’s a really  cool way to realize the economics of shield mining
1:27:22
that's all for today there's a lot to cover  there's a lot I chat about and in the next video I  
1:27:28
want to talk about what are the improvements that  can be done so how else can we use insurance to  
1:27:36
increase adoption for Defi to increase protection  for people and how else can we use the economics  
1:27:42
of signalling and aligning incentives between  principal and agent together to increase security  
1:27:49
and safety for people to come into the Defi space  and how else can we define the ROI for users to  
1:27:57
come into the space with Nexus Mutual so that’s  another big topic on its own I’ve been wrapping  
1:28:03
my head a lot around it and I wanted to include it  in this video but this video is really quite long   so if I include that that will be even longer  so anyway I really hope you enjoy this I hope  
1:28:13
the deep dive was good enough and there are a lot  more places that we can deep dive if you want one  
1:28:20
is looking at the capital model and one is looking  at the MCR model the capital model and MCR model  
1:28:25
is not just random numbers they plugged out of  the air because the people who created Nexus   Mutual the team is you know they have really  good experience they used to be doing all these  
1:28:35
remember I told you that insurance is basically  pricing risk so there is a specific kind of  
1:28:43
job scope to be pricing that they are called  actuarial or like actuarial scientists and their  
1:28:49
entire life it's pretty cool they take data they  find out how to price risk so the team has a lot  
1:28:54
of experience in that and that's why there's a lot  of math and considerations behind how the capital  
1:29:00
model is done how the MCR model is done and that's  a lot of math so if you want to do that let me let  
1:29:06
me know if you're interested in that and I can  go deep dive into it otherwise the next video   will be very much focused on the improvements and  how other protocols can partner with Nexus Mutual  
1:29:17
to increase adoption for the Defi at the same  time Nexus can be allocating its capital a  
1:29:22
lot more efficiently so I’ll see you in the next  video and if you have any comments and questions  
1:29:28
just drop them in the in the comments below  and I’ll speak to you in the next episode bye
