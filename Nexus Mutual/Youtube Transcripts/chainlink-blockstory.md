It was a light bulb moment for  me. I saw a message on a forum,  
0:04
I went online, and I watched millions  of dollars just getting drained.
0:12
This was a clear indication that we  needed some sort of insurance for hacks.
0:33
I grew up in Canberra, Australia. It was very  egalitarian, very comfortable. You can leave your  
0:39
door open, it's that type of place. You know,  it's also very community-driven. Looking back,  
0:44
that's kind of shaped I guess quite a few  of my views. I played a lot of board games,  
0:49
I play a lot of card games, maybe I was just a  stereotypical nerd. I started working for life  
0:54
insurance companies in Sydney. But I guess  after about 10 years it felt like it was  
0:59
time for a change. I took a year off and got on  a plane and started doing a bit of traveling.  
1:06
The first place I went to was Peru, and I guess it  was quite a bit different obviously from anything  
1:10
I'd been to before. They obviously have a lot of  earthquakes and a lot of houses being destroyed.  
1:16
I was asking around like, “Do people have  insurance for this stuff?” Obviously, that's my  
1:20
interest. The answer was “No,” and it did make me  realize that there are people behind the numbers.  
1:28
Today's insurance companies  are really shareholder driven,  
1:32
quite distant from the end  customer. I started thinking about  
1:36
taking insurance all the way back to its roots  of that cooperative or community-driven approach.
1:48
I guess I discovered Bitcoin relatively early. I  bought a few coins back then and put a few hundred  
1:55
dollars in it. Then I heard about Ethereum.  That's when I really started thinking about Nexus.  
2:04
I guess the reason I wanted to build  something insurance-related on the  
2:07
blockchain is because I knew that was the  value that I could add to the ecosystem.  
2:11
But one of the things I'd always been  struggling with was what's the product  
2:14
going to be, what are we going to  sell—and then the DAO hack happened.  
2:21
The DAO was a pooled investment fund. I could see  the money coming out minute by minute, millions of  
2:28
dollars just getting drained. I realized that  if the technology was going to be successful,  
2:34
then we needed to have some sort of insurance  product to protect against the hacking risk.
2:43
I knew what Nexus was about. I had the vision for  it. I thought about it for probably 18 months.  
2:50
I didn't necessarily go out wanting to be a solo  founder but decided that I might as well give it  
2:55
a shot. I'm actually reasonably good at having a  big picture view but also getting into the detail,  
3:01
and this kind of felt like the moment to at  least express my ideas to a wider audience.  
3:09
2017 Devcon, the Ethereum developer  conference, was in Cancun.  
3:14
Without a ticket to Devcon, I decided to  fly to Cancun for one day to do a 20-minute  
3:19
presentation. Everyone was telling me I was a  bit crazy. “The stage is yours, Hugh.” “So what  
3:24
is Nexus Mutal about?” I was a little bit nervous  but I met a whole bunch of the Ethereum community,  
3:30
blockchain OGs as it were, and that led directly  to our seed round being raised, and we partnered  
3:35
with Chainlink because you need what are called  oracles or data to tell you what's happening in  
3:41
the outside world. “Thank you so much, Hugh. Thank  you.” I felt like after that presentation that  
3:50
everyone was really, really keen to talk to me.  It was probably one of the best things I did.
3:58
Once we got to launch, things were looking  great, we were getting some traction,  
4:02
but I think I was very naive going into it.  
4:06
During the bear market of 2018, and into ‘19  we definitely went through some challenging  
4:12
times at Nexus. We were getting to the point  where we were running out of money basically.  
4:18
It was definitely really hard. I took a personal  loan out. I had to get rid of half the team.  
4:24
It was just a really extremely sickening feeling  like I physically had trouble walking around. But,  
4:33
as an actuary, you project out what's going to  happen in the future on a financial basis, and the  
4:39
projections we're talking about are 40, 50, 60,  70 years long, and so I very naturally have a very  
4:45
long-term view on things. The short-term nature  of crypto is very distracting, and being able to  
4:55
have a long-term focus is critical if you're going  to make a success of something in the longer term.
5:04
Nexus is at a really interesting point right  now. What we're trying to build is that old way  
5:08
of doing things where a community comes together,  shares risk, becomes more resilient as a society,  
5:14
and works together on their own terms.  What excites me about the technology or  
5:20
blockchain is really its open nature that anyone  can participate. It's the same rules for everyone,  
5:24
it's very egalitarian. I guess, you know,  that kind of goes back to how I grew up.
5:30
“Tip of the hat for Hugh, [it takes] blood, sweat,  
5:32
and tears to build something  that he's passionate about.”
5:35
“They almost shut down, [I’m]  glad he kept on building.”
5:41
One of the really important things  for what we want to take Nexus to  
5:44
is impact on the real  world—earthquake coverage in Peru,  
5:49
or whatever it is, but actually get outside  the specific Web3 world and into the real  
5:54
world, because fundamentally this  technology can really change things.
