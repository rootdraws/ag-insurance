Hello everybody and welcome to another
0:04
DeFi ask me anything episode with Brave
0:07
New Dei. Brave is head of risk and
0:10
product at Nexus Mutual and he will take
0:15
the last three or four questions on the
0:18
forum which you can find if you could go
0:21
to the search function at the top right
0:25
and um type in DI AMA. These are the
0:29
questions that we received for our first
0:33
DeFi and risk learning group cohort. The
0:36
participants had some really interesting
0:38
questions about cryptography, insurance,
0:42
risk and DeFi and our risk experts uh
0:46
are tackling
0:48
them. Okay, welcome welcome Rape. Any
0:52
any anything before we start?
0:56
No, I think let's jump into the
0:58
questions. Let's do that. We had
1:01
answered part of these questions with
1:03
Hugh at the first episode of the D5 AMA
1:06
and I will share them again timestamped
1:09
for the DRLG participants on the forum
1:12
and uh yeah, Brave is tackling the rest
1:14
of them before I do. Okay, let's
1:17
continue with G. Johnston's uh very
1:21
insightful interesting question that
1:23
also touches his personal experience um
1:26
as an underwriter. I think it's fair to
1:30
uh sum up part of his questions uh in in
1:34
three um bullet points and I feel like
1:37
one of the first questions he basically
1:39
had is where do cryptograph cryptography
The intersection of crypto, insurance and risk (gjohnston)
1:42
insurance and risk intersect?
1:47
Yeah. Yeah. Well, on this, you know,
1:48
cryptography is just a form of
1:50
encryption and cryptography is at the
1:52
heart of blockchain technology. So, when
1:54
the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks first
1:56
launch, they open up a wave of
1:58
innovation, but over time, we also
2:00
realize that blockchain technology
2:02
introduces new kinds of risks as well.
2:04
So, blockchain technology itself
2:08
uh is just another piece of technology
2:12
that we can use within the insurance
2:14
world. Um, and there's also new risks
2:17
that this technology brings. So, if we
2:20
can look at things like private key
2:22
loss, whether that's somebody losing
2:24
access to their private keys or through
2:26
common web 2 attack vectors like fishing
2:28
and social engineering, acts and
2:30
exploits in DeFi, um, you know, and a
2:32
variety of others. So, there are new
2:35
risks that come with these new
2:36
technologies and people want to protect
2:38
themselves against this. Um this is no
2:42
different than when computers and the
2:43
internet came out and then over time uh
2:46
there were new kinds of risks that
2:48
people were facing and so that's why we
2:49
see seen such an increase in demand for
2:52
things like cyber security insurance
2:54
products in the last 20 years because
2:56
computers have become such a cornerstone
2:58
of everyday life. The risk of being
3:00
locked out of your computer or having
3:01
your business information stolen are
3:04
that much more severe. So personally I
3:07
see blockchain risk as another variation
3:10
on this trend. There's new risks that
3:12
people want to protect themselves
3:14
against and in order to participate or
3:17
interact with this technology they need
3:19
to have some kind of protection. My
3:22
experience at Nexus, we know that funds,
3:25
institutions, retail users, and high uh
3:28
net worth individuals, any of these
3:30
folks a lot of times is a prerequisite.
3:33
They need to have coverage if they're
3:35
deploying funds on chain. So, this for
3:38
them is necessary if they want to
3:40
participate to participate in the
3:42
onchain economy. So I think as we see
3:45
blockchain technology and the
3:46
applications built on top of
3:48
blockchain's advance, there's going to
3:50
be a greater need for different kinds of
3:51
insurance and we're also going to see
3:53
more insurance companies looking to
3:55
leverage the benefits that blockchains
3:57
bring like automation and improved
3:59
efficiency. So that that my view is kind
4:02
of where cryptography
4:04
um insurance and risk all all meet
4:06
together.
Will some legacy insurance become obsolete? (gjohnston)
4:10
Thanks Brave.
4:13
I am very excited about how how this
4:16
field will develop and I I think G
4:20
Johnston is as well. He's asking will
4:23
some legacy insurance become obsolete
4:26
with layer ones or layer twos. What do
4:30
you think Brave?
4:32
Um my my answer here is I think there's
4:34
potential for blockchain technology to
4:36
reduce the cost of some forms of
4:37
insurance like title insurance. But I
4:40
don't believe it's going to become
4:41
obsolete as long as humans are involved
4:44
in managing the underlying data that
4:46
backs onchain records. People often talk
4:48
about, you know, you can tokenize
4:50
everything. You could tokenize the the
4:52
deed for your house. You can tokenize
4:54
it, but there's still something that
4:56
represents it in the real world. um even
4:58
if this was all just data on a computer
5:01
there still is at some you know in one
5:04
way or another there is some room for
5:06
human error involved so there's always
5:08
going to need for some kind of insurance
5:10
however I do think
5:13
that you can reduce the cost and improve
5:17
efficiency using blockchain technology
5:20
um so in the example of title insurance
5:23
I know a lot of people see title
5:25
insurance as a scam but I live in a
5:27
rural area and I know that title
5:29
insurance has saved uh more than a few
5:32
people um when they did a land sale
5:34
where they didn't actually have the
5:35
rights to all of the land they purchased
5:37
and they were able to claim on that
5:38
insurance and they weren't impacted by
5:41
it. There was one larger scale deal
5:43
where I live where a large company um a
5:46
large mining company bought some land
5:49
and they figured out they didn't own
5:50
part of it and they didn't have the
5:53
necessary title insurance and they lost
5:56
about $10
5:58
million. So it can have an impact there.
6:02
But again, you can reduce the cost of
6:04
title insurance. Um, and you can make
6:08
things a lot more efficient by putting
6:10
things on chain. So, if you were to put
6:12
this information on chain and create a
6:14
better system where that information
6:16
can't be lost and you can really
6:18
meaningfully reduce the cost of that
6:20
kind of insurance, title insurance and
6:22
other lines of business. Um, so the
6:24
biggest benefits I see are reductions in
6:26
cost due to higher levels of efficiency.
6:29
Uh I think there are other types of
6:32
insurance that can be offered but
6:34
again you can never reduce risk to zero.
6:37
So I don't think blockchain technology
6:39
is going to reduce any risk out there to
6:42
an absolute zero where people don't want
6:43
to have some kind of coverage for it. Uh
6:45
but again I think that we can improve
6:47
efficiency a lot and bring down the cost
6:49
of coverage over time.
6:54
Thanks Brave. related to that, how might
Nexus Mutual transforming risk management (gjohnston)
6:58
decentralized capital pools like Nexus
7:01
transform risk management and make the
7:05
field more efficient?
7:09
Yeah, I think capital coordination is
7:11
the biggest way and and again this comes
7:13
down to efficiency. So capital
7:15
coordination in traditional markets
7:16
takes a while. Um and a lot of this is
7:18
due to the business and legal
7:20
requirements that need to be approved
7:21
before a deal can move forward. you're
7:23
still going to have that to a certain
7:25
degree. But if companies were able to uh
7:27
source capacity from decentralized
7:30
underwriting pools um or even
7:32
permissioned underwriting pools that are
7:34
on chain and they can come to an
7:36
agreement on business terms, they could
7:37
bring deals to market with greater speed
7:39
than they currently do. They would need
7:41
uh to still have some of those legal
7:44
agreements in place. Um, but if they
7:46
could pair back the need for some of the
7:50
terms in in uh the legal proceedings or
7:52
the legal agreements, you could automate
7:54
a lot of that with smart contracts um
7:57
where somebody can't take money out
7:58
under certain conditions and uh that
8:01
could improve, you know, it could
8:04
improve the way that people can bring
8:06
deals to market. So again, speed and
8:08
efficiency here and that's where I see
8:10
the most potential uh for growth in
8:13
traditional insurance. From what we're
8:15
looking at on chain, you know, so far
8:17
with Nexus, we're not seeing people open
8:19
sourcing their underwriting models
8:21
because there's really no benefit to in
8:24
a lot of other places. Um, a lot of
8:27
other protocols, we see people open
8:28
source the code, but some of the data
8:30
sets they're using, they're not open
8:32
sourcing those because that's kind of
8:33
proprietary information. if every
8:35
underwriter open sourced their um
8:38
underwriting methodology, it would kind
8:40
of be a race to zero and there would be
8:42
it'd be very hard to compete with uh
8:43
with one another. But I do think that
8:47
using pricing in different pools
8:50
um is kind of a standard because right
8:52
now anybody can come and look at the
8:54
pricing on Nexus, but I can't say go and
8:57
look at the pricing in some traditional
8:59
markets unless I'm privy to that
9:01
information or I have access to that
9:03
information somewhere. So, I think
9:05
there's going to be a bigger push in
9:07
transparency so people can understand
9:09
what the risk is, what pricing looks
9:12
like, and over time I think we can
9:13
improve transparency for both
9:16
underwriters and for people that are
9:17
looking to buy coverage.
9:22
Thanks,
9:23
Brave. Also, thanks G. Johnston for
9:26
sharing highlights from your personal
9:28
experience as an underwriter as someone
9:31
who works closely to our space and we're
9:35
looking forward to how you'll find Nexus
9:38
Mutual and the architecture which I
9:41
think is quite amazing. Moving on to
9:43
sleep on its um interesting questions.
9:46
The first one um is a bit more on the uh
9:51
quantum resistant algorithms type um
9:55
advanced topics which anyone seeing this
9:59
who is an expert in these areas are
10:02
welcome to uh respond to on our forum.
10:05
We'd love to we'd love to have experts
10:08
discuss but um we're going to go over
10:11
the rest of them with Brave here as
10:14
well. So um the first question sleep on
10:18
it has for brave at the moment is people
Decentralized insurance using zk proofs + people risk (sl33ponit)
10:21
risk how to ensure users without full
10:25
KYC using ZK proofs.
10:30
So the biggest hurdle here is this needs
10:32
to be cleared with regulators. So
10:35
technically you could do this today. um
10:37
you can use EK proofs to prove someone's
10:41
identity um without requiring full KYC
10:45
but regulators don't see that as valid.
10:49
So to stay compliant companies that
10:51
require KYC need to maintain certain
10:53
records to adhere to um you know United
10:56
States, European Union uh and other
10:59
nations where they have regulations and
11:01
that all depends on which jurisdiction
11:03
that you're operating in. So the
11:06
innovation here needs really to happen
11:08
with uh regulators, not so much the tech
11:10
that we have because that tech is avail
11:12
uh is available. However, there are some
11:15
providers like some sub um which is one
11:17
of the KYC providers out there and they
11:20
have optionality to allow users to KYC
11:22
on subsums platform. So let's say that
11:24
you did this uh you onboarded to sum
11:27
through Coinbase and then you went
11:30
somewhere else that also uses Sumub. as
11:32
long as that provider um like uh for
11:36
example the mutual uses some sub um we
11:40
have the option where if you've already
11:41
KYC with them you don't need to KYC with
11:43
us they can use those records to make
11:46
you compliant so there are some things
11:49
like that but until we can get to using
11:52
ZK proofs to s to prove somebody's
11:55
identity without actually exposing their
11:57
information that needs to be something
12:00
that's accepted by regulators and I
12:02
still I think we're uh a little ways
12:03
away off from that at this point in
12:08
time. Before we move on to sleep on its
12:12
next question, I also want to highlight
12:15
what um yeah, highlight and ask Brave
12:18
about what he thinks about social
12:22
engineering types of risks which are
12:24
really hard to protect, but we've had
12:26
our fair share of experiences
12:29
uh both in terms of um our own and
12:34
mutual members coming to us. Brave, any
12:37
words on how to protect against social
12:39
engineering type of risks?
12:42
Yeah, be skeptical. Um, when when
12:45
something sounds too good to be true, it
12:47
usually is. So, what I'll say is if
12:51
you're not expecting an email from
12:52
somebody, if you're not expecting a DM
12:54
from somebody and they send you
12:56
something and there's some offer where
12:57
they want you to to click on something
13:00
or test some game or do something, it's
13:03
likely going to be a scam. Social
13:05
engineering is really hard. It's hard to
13:07
cover because people can game that. How
13:08
do I actually prove that somebody was
13:10
socially engineered and that they didn't
13:12
create a social engineering scam and
13:14
then sent themselves from a different
13:17
account a message and then clicked on it
13:18
and then lost their money when really
13:20
they still have access to that money. So
13:22
most of the things that we can't cover
13:24
because we either can't prove that it's
13:27
uh we can't prove whether or not a claim
13:29
is valid or if it's fraudulent or in
13:33
cases like social engineering um which
13:35
is a little bit of the first one. But
13:37
the second one is even if we could the
13:39
cost for that coverage would be
13:41
incredibly high um and nobody would want
13:43
to pay that. But because social
13:45
engineering is so prevalent and there's
13:46
many different ways to do it, the the
13:49
best thing you can do, especially if
13:50
you're in crypto, is for your wallet,
13:52
use something like I use Rabby wallet,
13:55
which has kind of a built-in scam
13:56
detector in there. So, it'll give you a
13:59
message like this looks like a malicious
14:00
transaction, you know, do not approve
14:02
this. There are other tooling out there
14:05
for like MetaMask and some other wallets
14:07
like Wallet Guard, Pocket Universe. So,
14:09
there is a lot of tooling out there to
14:11
prevent you from giving an approval to
14:13
somebody through your crypto wallet. Um,
14:16
but for a lot of things, just kind of be
14:18
vigilant. Um, read a little bit about
14:20
OPSAC and if somebody is sending you a
14:22
message and you're not expecting it, you
14:24
know, just be cautious. Um, and I always
14:27
tell people not to download PDFs. if you
14:31
do to put it into Google Drive before
14:33
accessing it. Um, don't open it up on
14:35
your computer in Adobe or something like
14:37
that because somebody can hide uh
14:39
malicious code inside of a PDF that can
14:41
be executed if you open it directly on
14:43
your on your computer without putting it
14:45
into something like um Google
14:47
Drive. So, that's that's my approach
14:51
there. I don't have a more comprehensive
14:52
answer than that, but it's just uh be
14:54
careful and be vigilant.
14:58
That's a great tip. Thanks, Brave. Also
15:01
thanks sleep on it. It's always nice to
15:03
have your interesting questions. Oh
15:06
sorry I forgot the last one um before
15:09
thanking both of you. Okay it's an
Simpler UX (sl33ponit)
15:12
actually one of my one of the favorite
15:14
one of the best questions in my view um
15:17
in terms of my own personal interests
15:19
simplicity. Can users get onchain
15:22
insurance without realizing it? I think
15:25
we do have some cases that we can talk
15:28
about here. Yeah. Right. What do you
15:30
think?
15:32
Yeah, they they can. This is largely up
15:34
to um teams that want to incorporate
15:36
coverage into their product offering.
15:39
So, there are people that can do this.
15:40
We offer native protocol cover for some
15:43
teams. So, that they're offering a
15:45
certain level of coverage by default. Um
15:48
so, you can be using a protocol. Um, for
15:51
example, we work with one of the teams
15:53
that's uh running like a bit tensor
15:55
subnet and they buy $25 million in
15:58
blanket coverage for their users. So if
16:00
there's some kind of loss, people that
16:02
are delegating to um the validators on
16:04
that subnet can be reimbursed from that
16:07
$25 million policy. Um, so we do have
16:10
examples like that and people that are
16:12
providing essentially what is like an
16:13
FDIC type product where people are
16:16
covered up to a certain amount. Um, but
16:18
again this is largely up to teams. um
16:20
that offer this. So what you're doing is
16:23
you're abstracting away buying cover
16:25
from the end user to somebody on the
16:27
team buying it be on behalf of users. So
16:30
we have seen people do this. Um I would
16:32
love to see more people do this to
16:34
protect uh their users by a certain like
16:37
default level. Um again like FTIC style
16:39
coverage but I think as time goes on
16:42
we'll see more teams um looking into
16:44
that as well. But uh yeah, this also
16:46
just comes down to teams that are
16:48
building and the UX they want to provide
16:50
for their users. So um we're always
16:52
happy to work with folks that are
16:53
interested in doing this.
16:59
Okay, again thank you Sleeponit and
17:01
thank you Brave. Um I just wanted to
17:04
note the website
17:08
nexusmutual.iocont is the best way to
17:10
reach RPD and product teams. Okay,
17:14
moving on to the next
17:16
question. It comes from
Creating efficient risk products in DeFi (Elliot)
17:20
Elliot. How can DeFi make
17:23
insurance/risk products more transparent
17:26
and capital efficient?
17:30
Yeah. So, on the transparency side, um
17:33
using Nex Mutual as an example, all of
17:36
our coverings are on chain. Um all of
17:38
our annex documents are on chain on IP
17:40
uh on
17:41
IPFS. Um all of the data that you could
17:45
want to know about the mutual is
17:46
available on chain and we host that on
17:48
our Dune dashboards where we aggregate
17:50
that data so it's easy for people to
17:51
read. So at any given time you can come
17:53
in and look and see how much capital
17:55
does the mutual have you know how much
17:56
underwriting capital do we have? Uh what
17:58
are our assets held in the capital pool?
18:01
What are they held in? You can look at
18:03
our current liabilities with the current
18:05
amount of active coverage that we're
18:06
underwriting. You can see the claims
18:08
that we've paid. You can see a detailed
18:10
breakdown of the voting record on Dune.
18:13
You can go and see, you know, the
18:15
summaries that we have on how past
18:17
claims were decided. Pretty much
18:19
everything that you would like to know,
18:21
you can access u without ever coming to
18:24
us. And we have all of that information
18:26
available. And all of that is because
18:28
that data is held onchain and can be
18:30
sourced from that onchain
18:32
data. I think over time uh this gives
18:35
you insight onto what providers are
18:38
fair, which providers are paying out.
18:40
You can also look at the terms of
18:42
service for any given cover product.
18:45
Again, all of this is available through
18:47
our SDK and available in the in the DAP
18:49
itself. Uh if you're looking at like a
18:51
traditional insurer, they often make it
18:54
difficult to get a hold of their
18:55
policies. one because they're competing
18:57
uh with other insurers, but that
19:00
information is is some proprietary and
19:02
they don't want to share those terms too
19:04
often. So, as a user, you have to get a
19:06
hold of somebody. You have to go through
19:08
certain steps to actually get the terms
19:10
and then you have to go through it. And
19:12
their insurance contracts tend to be
19:14
very, very long. Um, you know, we're
19:16
talking somewhere in the realm of uh
19:19
hundreds of pages of text to go through.
19:21
We try to keep our cover wording simple.
19:23
Um, I think the longest cover wording we
19:25
have
19:26
uh might be our crime policy which is
19:28
maybe 50 or so pages. Um but most other
19:31
ones range somewhere between um like
19:33
four to six pages long. So they're meant
19:35
to be shorter and digestible and and
19:37
more accessible for users. So I think
19:40
over time as people are building on
19:41
chain because things are onchain and
19:44
have to be transparent by default. um
19:47
we'll see greater transparency in what
19:49
kind of risks people are underwriting,
19:50
you know, what their capital holdings
19:52
look like and what kind of risks they're
19:54
underwriting and if they have a track
19:56
record of paying out. On the flip side
19:58
for capital efficiency, this comes to
20:00
how a protocol is actually designed. So
20:04
what we've seen in the past with some
20:05
other insurers is that they split their
20:07
capital pool. So they only have capital
20:10
efficiency on one chain, not across
20:12
multiple chains. One big difference with
20:15
how we do things at Nexus is that
20:17
capital pool stays on the Ethereum
20:18
network. And so all of our underwriting
20:20
capital is in one spot, which allows us
20:22
to underwrite um with up to uh 4.8 times
20:27
leverage for the capital pool. So if we
20:29
have $und00 million in the capital pool,
20:31
we could write up to $480 million of
20:34
coverage because all that capital is in
20:37
the same place. And we can diversify
20:40
risk enough where it's unlikely that any
20:42
one business line goes down because we
20:44
limit risk where any one policy that
20:48
we're writing out or anyone line of
20:49
business like a protocol cover, balance
20:51
protocol cover, we limit that to a
20:53
maximum of 20% of the assets in the
20:57
capital pool. So if there's one hack, it
20:59
doesn't bring down the entire capital
21:00
pool. And at most it would bring down
21:02
20% of it. But even in that case, um, we
21:06
don't see those levels too often unless
21:08
we're in a really hot bare market or a
21:10
really hot bull market, I'm sorry. Um,
21:13
so capital efficiency is going to depend
21:15
on design, but again, I think efficiency
21:19
in general about bringing deals to
21:21
market with speed um is definitely
21:23
something that we'll see with people
21:25
building onchain um, and building in
21:28
DeFi in the insurance space.
21:33
Thanks, Brave. A next question from
21:36
Elliot along the same lines. Can we
Creating massively better products than traditional insurance (Elliot)
21:40
create products massively better than
21:43
traditional insurance? I think yes. What
21:46
do you think?
21:48
Yeah. I mean, I guess it it depends when
21:50
you're talking about what's different.
21:51
um you know the
21:54
terms may be
21:56
different but largely some of the terms
21:59
are going to be very similar over time.
22:02
Uh again this comes down to efficiency.
22:05
So while it takes a while to receive a
22:07
payout from a traditional insurer uh
22:10
under a lot of different circumstances
22:11
we can improve the speed at which you
22:13
can actually receive your claim payouts.
22:16
uh there are things like parametric
22:17
coverage that you can enable and this is
22:19
parametric is available in traditional
22:22
markets as well but if you put this on
22:24
chain and you have all the right
22:25
triggers you can see a payout that's
22:27
very very fast um so I think in the
22:30
areas of how fast claims get paid out
22:33
how fast claims get decided a lot of
22:35
those key areas for somebody that's
22:37
actually buying coverage buying
22:38
insurance we can improve the user
22:40
experience quite a bit there as far as
22:43
like the legal terms I I don't know if
22:45
those change too much with blockchain
22:47
tech, but ultimately it's the efficiency
22:50
and speed that we can really improve um
22:52
with onchain coverage. So those are the
22:55
areas where I see there being a massive
22:56
benefit and again over time if you can
22:59
improve efficiency you can also bring
23:01
down the cost of coverage over time
23:02
which I think is the massive benefit
23:04
that most people are looking for when
23:05
they're looking at buying insurance or
23:07
coverage.
23:11
Thanks
23:12
Brave. A last question from
23:17
Elliot. Can better security remove the
23:20
need for insurance altogether? I think
23:22
this is one of those questions where
23:24
it's really interesting to brainstorm
23:26
about, but I feel like the open source
23:28
nature of things really forbids us to go
23:32
further when it comes to security. And
23:34
you're quite an expert when it comes to
23:36
security. So, what do you think, Brave?
23:39
No. My answer on this is no. Um you
23:43
again you can never you can never reduce
23:45
risk to zero. So you can invest a lot in
23:49
security. I'll use the Oiler Finance V1
23:52
exploit as an example. So in 2023 uh
23:56
Oiler Finance was hacked for about $200
24:00
billion. Oiler was a very innovative
24:02
lending protocol. Um their V2 has been
24:04
very successful. They've had a great
24:06
relaunch and everything and I'm really
24:07
happy to see their V2 take off. But when
24:11
they had their V1, you know, lots of
24:13
people were using it. It was very
24:14
efficient. People really like the user
24:16
experience. They innovated on a lot of
24:18
things. They had like, I don't know, 10
24:20
or 20 audits. They invested heavily in
24:23
security and they still got exploited.
24:25
So, you
24:27
can invest heavily in security. You can
24:30
have a really high bug bounty program.
24:32
Um, but all it takes is one black hat,
24:34
right? So, you've got white hat hackers,
24:37
people that are ethical hackers that
24:38
report responsible disclosures if they
24:40
find a vulnerability. And then you've
24:42
got black hat hackers, and they don't
24:44
care about incentives. They don't care
24:46
if you offer them $2 million to report a
24:49
vulnerability because they know that
24:51
they can make 200 million if they just
24:52
exploit the protocol. Um we see that uh
24:56
North Korean state sp uh state sponsored
24:59
groups
25:01
um and everything they have been
25:04
responsible for some of the largest
25:05
hacks we've seen like the one that we
25:07
saw um with Bybit and some of the other
25:11
exchanges and decentralized protocols
25:14
we've seen like the Ronin Bridge hack.
25:16
Um a lot of these have you know have
25:20
been uh perpetrated by these North
25:22
Korean state sponsored government uh
25:25
organizations like you know broadly we
25:27
call them like Lazarus. So you can have
25:31
better security but it still doesn't
25:33
remove that risk to zero. Um with better
25:36
security over time if we see the
25:38
instance of exploits and losses go down
25:42
you can bring the pricing down. Uh, but
25:44
I don't think that improved security is
25:47
ever going to make anything airtight
25:50
because I I think it's the case of like
25:52
the old example of the Titanic, right?
25:54
Um, they said that thing had 120 holes
25:57
and it was never going to sink and then
25:58
it hit an iceberg and now it's at the
26:01
bottom of the ocean. So, you can think
26:03
that your security is airtight until one
26:05
day somebody finds a leak. Um, and
26:07
again, this is what insurance exists for
26:09
in the first place. it's to hedge
26:12
against and remove risk from the
26:14
equation for different people and then
26:16
they pay some cost for that. So again, I
26:19
don't think there's any scenario in life
26:21
where you reduce risk to zero. Um, but I
26:23
guess that's my perspective as somebody
26:25
who looks at risk all the time um and is
26:28
looking at upset risk and a wide variety
26:31
of risks outside of uh what we even
26:33
cover at Nexus.
26:36
Thanks Brave. I also remembered a couple
26:39
conversations with friends in DeFi who
26:42
claimed that at least for them the need
26:45
for insurance was non-existent because
26:48
they you know they were acting quite
26:50
securely and they were only working with
26:52
protocols that they trusted but I think
26:55
one interesting thing is the aspect of
26:58
interoperability like a lot of a lot of
27:01
projects share similar structures and
27:04
yeah code bases and libraries and I
27:07
think That's also another angle that
27:09
people tend to forget about and Nexus
27:12
Mutual offers protection for. Thank you
27:15
so much, Brave. It was amazing having
27:16
you at the Defi AMA. Um, we have another
27:20
question by Moss. I think it is best
27:23
answered um in a written way because he
27:27
was he's asking um about a you know risk
27:31
bucket calculation type of uh situation.
27:34
So, I'm going to leave it to you to
27:36
answer on the forum. And um this
27:39
concludes our first series for the D5
27:43
AMA. And let's hope that we continue
27:46
with these um episodes as we dive deeper
27:50
with the first learning
27:51
cohort. Thanks again. Talk to you soon.
27:55
Bye. Bye.
