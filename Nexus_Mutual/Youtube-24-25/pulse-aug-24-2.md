0:52
today let's kick things off with the
0:55
state of defi Hugh over to you how is
0:58
the state of defi these days and um yeah
1:02
what are your sentiments for the
1:03
upcoming days take it
State of DeFi
1:07
away hey everyone just on the main
1:09
account um today so um yeah I guess
1:12
quite a few things going on this week um
1:15
but um obviously the the price drops and
1:18
stuff has affected um a lot of the
1:20
yields mainly that they've been a bit
1:22
compressed over over the past few weeks
1:24
so um but I guess things seem to be
1:27
stabilizing um at the moment so I guess
1:30
um it's hard to tell obviously which way
1:32
things are going to go from here but um
1:34
but in general if um if we can get a bit
1:37
more stability and things and and
1:39
hopefully the the start um start Rising
1:42
again and I guess more macro if um if
1:45
the inflation rates are under control
1:48
and and the central banks start um
1:50
dropping dropping interest rates a bit
1:51
more then then maybe that um Spurs
1:53
things up a bit um in the in the medium
1:55
term but I guess we just have to kind of
1:57
wait and wait and see on that type of
1:59
thing I guess two main um things
2:02
happening in in Def that I've um be done
2:06
over the weeks I guess um the
2:11
EF um the I guess the flows have been
2:15
continuing to
2:21
come which has most of the outflows now
2:26
that redemptions are effectively enabled
2:29
um that's kind of
2:30
stabilized or roughly zero so um just
2:34
just recently and so hopefully that um
2:36
seems like a it could be a bit of a
2:38
turning point for things obviously wait
2:40
and see how how stuff goes but but I
2:42
thought that was I thought that was
2:43
pretty interesting and I guess another
2:45
thing more generally on the on the risk
2:47
side uh within within D that I've seen
2:50
is are the change the potential changes
2:52
or changes proposed with wrapped BTC so
2:56
um this is like the the BTC WP on on
2:59
area main net which is like pretty um
3:03
it's I don't know I would really like to
3:05
see more BTC usage within Defi and so I
3:07
think the rap BTC is quite quite
3:09
important um and the this I'm not too
3:13
sure of the exact changes but there are
3:14
a bunch of changes being proposed about
3:16
how the custody of that R BTC works so
3:19
basically it's a um it's a multi- on the
3:22
Bitcoin um blockchain which is um held
3:26
um and covered by bitgo I believe um and
3:31
that there's been some changes proposed
3:32
to how that actually operates and um as
3:35
a result of that a maker make is looking
3:38
to offboard R BTC is a collateral um in
3:42
the makad ecosystem so because they
3:45
perceive a quite um change or increase
3:47
in risk as a result of that change which
3:50
um I don't necessarily disagree with um
3:53
but to me um I'd really love to see a
3:56
solid stable W BTC within the white
3:59
ecosystem because I think there's a lot
4:01
of potential um assets and and value
4:04
that can um be used more widely within
4:07
um defi um to to yields and play and we
4:11
we see a lot of demand for like people
4:12
wanting to actually um more use of their
4:15
BTC so um you know see how that plays
4:18
out from a risk perspective um I
4:21
personally hope that if if it's not good
4:24
enough for make a DA to have us
4:26
collateral then we need an alternative
4:29
that that is good enough um because I
4:32
see that as a pretty important pillar in
4:34
the um in the defi ecosystem so hoping
4:36
that um those changes if they I guess if
4:38
they do happen that we do get a
4:40
substitute that that that's scalable Etc
4:43
and and just good enough on the risk
4:45
side so I guess those are the kind of
4:47
couple of main points that I've picked
4:48
up um over the last um the last few
4:51
weeks so yeah I don't know um s if you
4:53
have any comments or questions on of
4:56
that thanks you um I think this was a
4:59
great summary of the biggest events that
5:02
were underway last week and um yeah I I
5:06
completely agree with your comments um
5:09
if there's anybody else that would like
5:11
to chip in with how they perceive the
5:14
state of defi these days please um do so
5:17
please send a uh request to talk and
5:20
we'll make sure to make your voice
5:27
heard if not
5:30
I'd like to provide an update on two
5:32
important governance discussions
5:34
currently underway in our
5:37
community um and you know you can always
5:40
uh you can always talk about your
5:42
comments in the open Forum
5:44
section in governance first we have the
Governance Updates
5:48
nomination of Lee mlen to The Advisory
5:51
Board Lee has been a dedicated member of
5:54
the Nexus Mutual team for the past three
5:57
years he initially contributed as a
5:59
communication specialist and later as
6:03
part of the product and risk team Lee
6:06
has played a pivotal role in several key
6:08
initiatives such as overhauling our
6:11
claims response process developing the
6:14
Dow tra teams framework which I became a
6:17
part of uh later on and launching the
6:21
bundled protocol cover products which
6:23
was a great success earlier this year
6:26
given his extensive experience and deep
6:29
commitment the Nexus Mutual Lee has
6:31
nominated himself as a replacement for
6:33
Nick monos McDonald who is stepping down
6:36
from The Advisory
6:38
Board this proposal is currently open
6:41
for comment on the Nexus Mutual Forum
6:43
until August 13th after this period it
6:46
will move to a Nexus Mutual protocol
6:48
Improvement proposal also known as nmip
6:52
for further review from August 14th to
6:55
August 21st before potentially
6:58
proceeding to an onchain vote
7:00
if you have any comments um or words to
7:03
support Lee please do so on the next
7:05
Mutual
7:07
Forum additionally there's a significant
7:10
proposal from katki regarding the
7:13
management of our da treasury katki is a
7:17
defin native organization with
7:19
experience in Dow treasury management
7:22
and they are proposing to manage our
7:24
treasury assets using non-custodial
7:27
Solutions their strategy is quite
7:29
detailed it includes diversifying out of
7:32
wrapped nxm and nxm into eth eth
7:35
derivatives and stable coins aiming for
7:38
a diversified portfolio worth
7:42
approximately uh $6.5 million their
7:45
services would be compensated with a 05%
7:48
management fee and a 20% performance fee
7:51
on the yield
7:54
generated this proposal is designed to
7:57
enhance the financial stabil sustain
7:59
ability of our Dow reduce concentration
8:02
risk and improve our Capital
8:05
efficiency currently the proposal is
8:08
open for review and comments on the
8:11
Nexus Mutual Forum until August 19th
8:14
after which it will transition to a nmdp
8:18
Nexus Mutual da proposal for further
8:21
discussion and potential
8:23
approval I encourage all members to
8:26
review the details on the Nexus Mutual
8:28
forum at forum. Nexus
8:31
mutual. and to participate in the
8:37
discussions now I'd like to ask you to
8:40
give the latest updates from the
8:42
foundation
Updates From The Foundation
8:45
you cool thanks then um yeah just just a
8:49
few comments on the governance updates
8:51
um Le Lee's been a great contributor to
8:53
to the Dow um over the years it's been
8:56
great to see him grow from um getting in
8:59
as a community member just getting stuck
9:00
in with a few little things and then
9:02
taking more and more steps forward
9:04
becoming a permanent contributor and
9:06
then um and now potentially being on The
9:08
Advisory Board yeah strong support from
9:09
me on on that side of things so um it's
9:12
been great to see him um grow as a as a
9:15
team member um also on kapaki I think
9:18
it's just worth very um just making
9:20
clear to everyone that that there are
9:22
two pots of money um one's the onchain
9:25
capital pool and that's not what this is
9:27
about um this is um about the the Dow
9:30
treasury funds um which used to pay the
9:32
Dow contributors and stuff so um it's
9:34
it's not the big Capital pull of 200
9:36
million it's a it's a smaller pot of
9:38
money um but um but I'm really looking
9:40
forward hopefully the Kaki from my
9:43
perspective personally I hope the Kaki
9:45
um proposal gets um approved there've
9:47
been some really solid um uh services
9:51
that they provided within to multiple DS
9:53
within the ecosystem um and I think
9:55
there's actually a wider strategic
9:56
Alliance um that can be kind of helped
9:59
for with that with that group um
10:01
especially when Nexus can like support
10:05
um support kapaki and being able to
10:08
deploy funds for other Dows and making
10:10
sure we can provide smart contract
10:12
coverage Etc so I think there's a
10:13
there's a wider partnership there that
10:15
could potentially develop but but this
10:16
one specifically is about the managing
10:19
of the Dow treasury um cool so on after
10:23
those quick notes just on the foundation
10:25
side of things I guess a lot of stuff
10:27
going on um UI enhancements continue to
10:30
be worked on and rolled out so there
10:32
some kyc stuff um flows um went out um
10:35
recently then um we're working heavily
10:38
on the staking and and the claim side of
10:40
things now so they're a bit more
10:41
complicated especially the staking one
10:43
but um the stuff's looking good um
10:45
obviously bit more work to do but I'm
10:47
working on that um in terms of the more
10:50
like backend protocol side of things uh
10:54
cover edits um continues to to plot
10:57
along we're also going to be um shipping
11:00
a few minor updates which are more
11:03
related to just getting things sorted in
11:06
the right places so that we can actually
11:08
do cover edit it's kind of like we we
11:10
run into max contract size and stuff and
11:12
things so there's a few of those types
11:14
of up updates how that are going to
11:15
happen over the coming weeks first and
11:18
then I guess more broadly uh in terms of
11:22
um product and other other bits and
11:24
pieces really excited to kind of um you
11:27
hopefully may have seen the formal coms
11:28
around the dialectic fund portfolio
11:30
cover stuff yesterday um really excited
11:33
to kind of make that more broadly um
11:36
aware of um I guess and um and we're
11:39
getting some really interesting
11:41
conversations happening off off the back
11:42
of that people see it as a um people see
11:45
it really positively and so to to very
11:48
quickly summarize it's basically uh def
11:51
defi kind of yield generating funds like
11:53
dialectic um they have an e based fund
11:56
and a stable coinbase fund um and
11:58
they're buying comprehensive coverage
12:00
against all smart contract risk that
12:01
they're kind of exposed to um and so we
12:03
just bundle up in one package and and as
12:05
long as they stay within their risk
12:07
framework um then then it can be covered
12:09
so kind think is really kind of
12:10
innovative product specifically designed
12:14
for how crypto funds actually operate um
12:17
and um yeah it's a it's a pretty big
12:19
deal for for for Nexus um and I I think
12:22
a really great step forward for risk
12:24
management within defi so check that out
12:26
if um if you haven't um already um but
12:29
that's that's some pretty exciting
12:31
news on some other notes we um spending
12:36
I'm spending the most of this week um in
12:38
deep workshops with some potential um
12:40
with some Distributors that we're um
12:42
working quite closely with more on the
12:44
traditional Insurance um broking side um
12:47
so there's definitely um I think there's
12:49
a broader Trend it's probably worth
12:51
noting that um there's a lot of um the
12:56
the traditional Insurance base has been
12:58
moving more toward WS crypto and it's
13:00
becoming more and more acceptable um and
13:02
then the um and the real kind of defi
13:05
native stuff so what we do is is
13:07
becoming um we're also kind of training
13:10
a bit more the other way um offering
13:12
looking to offer products that are more
13:14
kind of closer to um traditional
13:17
Insurance type products so like dno
13:19
coverage and other things like that so
13:21
there's I guess what I'm trying to say
13:23
there is just at a higher level there's
13:24
more of a convergence into the middle
13:26
both kind of parties are moving um into
13:28
the middle a little bit more and so
13:30
there's going to be a lot of
13:31
opportunities coming out um as a result
13:33
of that and one of the big goals for the
13:35
foundation is to support distribution
13:37
and growth for the mutual and kind of
13:39
this is going to be a key part of that
13:42
so um lots of stuff going on and it's
13:44
all about making sure we do the
13:46
processes have the right products to
13:47
support um them and um they can sell
13:51
discretionary coverage rather than
13:53
insurance and and all the bits and
13:54
pieces that come with it so I'm really
13:56
excited to get into the details to make
13:58
it actually real cuz there's only one
13:59
way actually making it happen is go
14:01
through all the nitty-gritty so um
14:03
that's been that's been really good um
14:05
today and I guess a few more days this
14:07
week so um I guess a lot of interesting
14:10
stuff going on on the found on the
14:12
foundation side um yeah happy to take
14:15
any questions on on any of
