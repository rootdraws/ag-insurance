Welcome to this stepbystep guide on
0:08
purchasing protocol cover. In this
0:11
video, we'll walk you through how to
0:13
find and buy protocol cover to protect
0:16
your assets from major risks, including
0:19
smart contract exploits, severe oracle
0:22
failures, liquidation failures, and
0:25
governance attacks. Let's dive in.
0:30
Step one, access the UI at app.n
0:34
nexusmutual.io.
0:37
First, go to app.n nexusmutual.io.
0:41
To proceed with a purchase, you will
0:43
need to connect your wallet and be a
0:46
member of the mutual. Not a member yet?
0:49
No problem. You can still explore
0:51
listings and check pricing before
0:53
joining us.
0:56
Step two, search for listings.
1:00
On the cover section of the UI, you will
1:03
see a list of cover options. By default,
1:06
public listings available to all users
1:09
are displayed.
1:12
If you're looking for a specific
1:13
protocol or category, let's see how you
1:16
can find it. Use the search bar to
1:19
quickly find a protocol.
1:22
You can also browse by category or
1:25
product type using the drop- down menus.
1:29
Each listing shows key details.
1:32
Annual cover fee, the cost of coverage
1:35
per year, available capacity, the amount
1:39
of cover available.
1:42
If a listing has no available capacity,
1:46
click request capacity and submit the
1:49
form. The product and risk team will
1:52
reach out via email.
1:56
Step three, generate quote.
1:59
You will see the cover cost generated
2:02
once you have entered all the details to
2:04
the left of the UI.
2:09
Once everything looks good, review the
2:12
terms and conditions before proceeding.

Double check the cover amount, period,
2:22
and cost in the overview section to the
2:25
right. Adjust slippage if necessary.
2:30
Select your payment method from the
2:33
drop-down under cover cost. Ensure your
2:36
wallet is connected and that spending is
2:39
approved for the required amount.
2:41
Finally, click purchase cover and
2:44
confirm the transaction in your wallet.
2:47
That's it. Your cover is now active. You
2:51
can manage your covers anytime from the
2:54
your covers section on the main cover
2:56
page of the UI as well. Thanks for
