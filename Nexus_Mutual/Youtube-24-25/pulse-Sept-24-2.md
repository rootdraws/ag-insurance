hey everyone welcome to this week's Nexus Mutual Community call great to have you with us as we dive into the
0:11
latest in an Nexus Mutual ecosystem let's review today's
0:17
agenda as always Brave New defi will lead a discussion on defi yields and
0:24
risks we'll then take a quick look at the new listings in the next Mutual UI
0:31
plus we'll have some governance and Foundation updates then there will be a special
0:38
segment with a guide for anyone with cover or Stak nxm in V1
0:46
contracts we'll wrap up with an open forum for questions comments and info on
0:54
claiming your poab for attending today let's start with the state of defi
1:01
Brave how are things looking in the space right
1:07
now yeah I think things are still kind of sideways like we talked about last time um yeah good morning everyone I'll
1:15
provide an overview of the current market and the yield environment in defi before we get into some other updates
1:21
today since our last call the price of ether has ranged between $2,100 and $2,500 with today's price hovering
1:28
around that the middle of that range at uh 2,340 bucks eth price action hasn't
1:35
been very strong and the market isn't incredibly bullish at the moment uh if you look at eth Perpetual
1:41
futures um they kind of indicate that we're kind of flipping uh more away from
1:47
bullishness so funding rates across major exchanges are slightly negative which means that major centralized
1:53
exchanges and onchain per markets are paying people to go long eth to attract more Traders into the market
2:00
we've seen a lot of talk in the last few weeks about low gas prices on maet positive eth issuance on a yearly basis
2:07
and since there's insufficient eth being burned to create a deflationary supply people are concerned about this and
2:14
there's been General worries about eth price action in the short term um there's been a lot of different
2:19
discussions about why that might be uh but a lot of that is just kind of noise
2:24
that's on crypto Twitter um people have complained about the ethereum foundation selling e people have complained about
2:31
this and that um about you know uh the Advent of blobs lowering gas costs
2:37
across the ecosystem again a lot of this is still noise I think that everyone expected the eth ETFs to really boost prices to new
2:44
Highs but crypto markets are still closely correlated with Trends in traditional markets and in traditional
2:49
markets we've seen growing concerns about a potential recession the August jobs report just came out last week uh
2:55
that was released by the United States Department of Labor and that indicated a weakening labor market and that report
3:01
itself when it came out triggered to sell off in traditional markets uh with tech stocks being hit the hardest and
3:07
typically crypto markets are correlated to Tech stock performance over time as I
3:12
shared in our last Community call there's a lot writing on the United States presidential election in November so I'd expect price action to remain
3:18
largely the same it is now uh until mid November when we kind of see the results of that
3:24
election how has the market action affected defi markets well we've lost roughly 4 billion an overall tvl locked
3:31
in defi since we had our last call but the Benchmark lending rates are still in the same median range for stable coin
3:37
yields and lending markets with rewards offered the median yield is about 4.15% this is down about 10 basis points
3:44
from our last call and the median stable coin yield for based interest rates in lending markets is 3.68% which is down
3:51
20 basis points since our last call the highest yields in lending markets are largely across notional V3 markets Moro
3:58
markets and a go yields the die savings rate remains at 6% it's still higher
4:04
than the median yields that we're seeing for stable coins and lending markets um and that's still the north car uh North
4:11
Star for stable coin yields when maker Dow re brains the sky money here in the next week or two um
4:18
we're going to see the new stable coin being offered by uh maker or Sky um usds
4:27
that's going to launch and the sky savings rate the SSR uh is going to be
4:32
6.25% as well so we'll see that that savings rate bump up a little bit to attract more Capital to the new usds
4:39
stable coin um like I said that upgrade should be happening in the next couple of weeks so while there are still great
4:45
yield opportunities available in defi yields are down across the market um protocols like contango still offer
4:51
double- digigit yields but that involves using leverage so definitely use caution if you're using leverage in the markets
4:58
onchain risks are still causing losses in defi with the pen py hack last week kicking off September with a $20 million
5:06
uh $27 million loss due to a reentrancy vulnerability that was exploited the
5:11
funds have not been returned and it's looking likely that funds are not going to be recovered for the pinpai hack uh
5:17
I've been working on a few research projects um as part of the product and risk team uh one of which is a database
5:24
of all of the exploits that have taken place in the ethereum and evm ecosystem based on the data that I've so far it's
5:30
looking like reiny attacks are one of the leading causes of Lo leading causes of losses in defi across the
5:37
years um but looking at immuni reports they just released their August 2024
5:42
report not too long ago and that highlights total loss of a little over 15 million due to hacks and fraud across
5:50
five specific incidents um most of the losses in August were due to hacks uh
5:57
that represents a 38% decrease from August 2023 when registered losses were
6:04
uh 24.5 million and it's uh 94.5% decrease month over month uh in July
6:10
there was a big um exchange hack for uh an Indian crypto exchange which made up
6:16
for most of the volume in July uh but in August 2024 defi surpassed CI with five
6:23
cases occurring representing 100% of the total volume of lost funds hacks
6:29
continue to be the predominant cause of losses compared to fraud uh a total of
6:34
15, 82,000 were lost to hacks across five incidents um no fraud no fraud
6:41
events were reported in August based on immuni reports the most targeted change
6:46
in August of 2024 were ethereum and the binance smart chain um that represented
6:52
100% of the total losses across targeted chains so if you're active in defi you're still exposed to these risks be
6:59
sure to be safe out there and buy cover when you can it's still the easiest way to protect against onchain hacks and
7:04
economic risks uh with an overview of the yield and risk landscape wrapped up let's talk
7:11
about some of our new listings in the last two weeks we've added a few new listings uh We've added pancake swap
7:17
protocol cover beefy and vdrome bundled protocol cover and our newest product
7:22
type and it's first listing the Bas def5 pass if you haven't seen some of the
7:28
announcements we've put out with open cover about the D5 pass I'll provide an overview of the product since BND
7:34
protocol cover has been so popular we wanted to explore um we wanted to explore a new
7:43
product that could provide users with greater flexibility I know people always want to buy cover um and Chase yield
7:50
which means moving your funds into the protocols with the highest available yield so instead of having to buy
7:56
several covers to protect your position um you can just buy one defi pass to protect your funds across several
8:02
protocols so we're starting with the base defi pass and this is designed to provide protection for the leading
8:07
protocols in the base ecosystem open cover is going to be selling and distributing this cover in their UI
8:13
because open cover sells cover on l2s gas fees are negligible and the base
8:20
def5 pass can be used by anyone whether you have $500 or 100,000 so since this
8:26
product and listing are both new we're working with open cover to conduct beta testing of the Bas defi pass to get
8:33
feedback from users so we can improve the UI and make any product adjustments before a larger launch based on the
8:39
feedback we received so if you want to take part in the beta testing phase head to the open
8:46
cover Twitter account and access their type form where you can take a short survey and request access so uh the Bas
8:53
defi pass allows you to protect yourself across eight leading protocols including Aerodrome beefy Finance compound V3
9:00
extra Finance moonwell Moro overnight finance and Unis swap V3 this also
9:06
includes the some protocols for these protocols so if it's a yield aggregator that's built on top of others you're
9:13
going to be covered across the full uh stack of risk so if you're looking at a BP Vault for example if you're deposited
9:19
in a vault if there's underlying protocols using that strategy you'll be protected against hacks and those protocols as well so if you were to
9:26
purchase 25,000 of Base D5 pass cover you could deposit a total of 25,000
9:33
across these protocols so to be clear I don't mean 25,000 in each protocol what
9:38
I'm saying is an aggregate total of 25,000 across the protocols so that could be 10,000 and more fo um 10,000 in
9:46
extra Finance 2500 in moonwell and 2500 in beefy that would make up your total
9:52
covered amount uh I'm really excited to see the base D5 pass go live but first
9:57
we'll do some testing get that able feedback from users uh before making a larger marketing push and then we'll
10:04
have more announcements on the Bas D5 pass here in the next month or so so yeah like I said head over to open cover
10:11
um to their Twitter accounts follow out that type form and check out the Bas defi pass um in the next week too we're
10:18
going to be adding some more listings so keep a lookout for some of those announcements I also wanted to share an
10:23
update about a project that our engineering team is working on so we shared an update on Twitter yesterday a
10:29
about a project that the Foundation Engineering team has been working on for the last week and they'll be working on
10:35
uh this week probably and early next week as well so since V2 launched in March 2023 some members still haven't
10:42
withdrawn their nxm they had deposited in the V1 contracts the Foundation Engineering team is working to deprecate
10:49
the V1 smart contracts and remove support for the uh V1 smart contracts in
10:56
our UI um so they don't have to maintain that any further as part of that project
11:02
they are claiming nxm that's held in the B1 smart contracts on behalf of members and covering the gas cost to the
11:07
transfer back to each member's wallet in total there's a little over 2,000 members who will see some nxm balance
11:13
transferred to their wallet over the next week if they haven't already the engineering team has already claimed to transferred V1 nxm related to cover
11:20
deposits claim assessment stakes and staking rewards the final part of the project will be to claim and transfer
11:25
nxm held in the V1 pulled staken contract which is where risk assessment
11:31
Stakes were held in the V1 protocol our Engineers estimate this will be completed by the end of this week or
11:36
early next week so if you see an exm appear in your wallet you can always verify the legitimacy of the token by
11:42
checking it against the official token contract address which can be found at sdk. Nexus
11:49
mutual. you can also go on coin Gecko and find the contract address there um
11:54
just a reminder that the nxm token is only on ethereum mainnet it's not on any other netor network uh if you have any
12:01
questions feel free to reach out to us through the contact form on the website or you can open a ticket in the Nexus
12:06
Mutual Discord server um yeah and on that I see that we've got
12:12
Q on the call so let me just get him up on the stage so he can provide his foundation update just one
12:20
second all right I'll hand it over to you H hey everyone hope you can hear me all
12:25
right um sorry it just says the list yep okay cool thanks Sam um all good how how's
12:33
everyone doing hope they're doing all right um few I guess a few updates from my side um was going to run through the
12:40
V1 deprecation but um Braves just um just mentioned all that so um yeah just
12:45
just in case you see nxm coming in um to wallet that's that's probably where it's where it's come from um we're just
12:51
moving that so it's just a bit easier for the engineering team and a bit of a smaller um codebase to to manage
12:57
especially in the in the UI side um a couple of other things on um on the
13:03
engineering side of things while we're on that topic so I guess the main um
13:08
pieces that we're working on at the moment are there's um definitely a whole bunch of UI stuff so we're testing
13:14
claims and and staking um UI um at at the moment so that's kind of progressing
13:19
quite well um there's a couple of backend pieces that um that we're working on as well um but I guess more
13:26
on the um protocol like enhancement side of things um the two main um ones that
13:32
are probably worth um mentioning cover edits um is continuing along and we're
13:39
also I'm going to be picking up um capability for for limit orders on by C
13:45
so um that's going to be quite cool where you can um essentially sign a message and and and some and if when the
13:51
capacity becomes available someone can um can complete the order and essentially it also allows gas to be
13:58
paid on behalf of users and a few tricky things like that so um there's there's quite a lot of cool capability with that
14:05
one but um but we're going to be picking that one up next once we've got over some of the for the UI um pieces and
14:11
this and this uh V1 uh deprecation so that's kind of the main stuff on the on
14:17
the engineering side I guess on the um business development side there's quite
14:22
a lot of um I guess bespoke or tailored quotes that
14:27
we're working through at the moment definitely some staking um two or three staking quotes we're working on um some
14:34
new product stuff we're working on um we're also pting supporting open cover with the the def5 pass um roll out um as
14:41
well which is pretty cool and we've also been having some interesting discussions with um potential syndicates more in the
14:49
um Real World um side of things as well so I think a lot of people are starting to realize what um what Nexus is capable
14:55
of and what they can they can use it for um so not not just covering crypto risks
15:00
but kind of also being a platform which would which they can use um to um distribute their own cover products Etc
15:07
so um having some very interesting conversations on on that side so you know definitely early stage but um I
15:13
think people are starting to realize how how um flexible um the the platform actually is when you when you kind of
15:20
get under the hood and um look at the details so um I'd say quite a lot going
15:25
going on across the the engineering side as well as the um the BD side um it's
15:32
definitely as I've said before on numerous of these calls we're definitely kind of focused on making sure that the
15:39
protocol has the particular capabilities in terms of what we need um to distribute cover but it's all about
15:45
distribution and growing out um The Syndicate base and and the cover
15:51
products that we offer so really excited to see things like open cover do their
15:56
um the the def pass stuff as well as the the transaction cover that they've done
16:02
um and we're also got some um definite interest um on new clients for the um
16:09
fund portfolio cover that we launched with dialectic so um there's quite a large range of covers that we offer at
16:14
the moment um and um we're also working on a whole bunch of these kind of tailored deals and things coming along
16:21
so um there's people want us to cover different things and they're exploring if we can do it or not um which is great
16:27
um so there's a lot of detailed work behind the scenes on that type of stuff that's but um I think that's kind of gives you a good overview of where uh
16:34
the foundation teams are are spending their time happy to take any questions on on
16:42
that all right if there's no questions then I can um move on to some governance
16:50
updates uh so we've had a little bit of activity here in the last several weeks um definitely since our last call so I
16:56
wanted to provide a quick update on some things happening on the governance forum and the recent snapshot vote so to
17:05
start let's talk about nmdp 8 which went up for vote on August 29th this vote was
17:11
to decide whether or not we should on board karpaty is the Dow treasury manager for the mutual so after a 5-day
17:18
voting period members voted with 174k nxm to approve the proposal so after
17:26
this pass um we've started working to onboard car Pat key to the Dow they are
17:32
configuring an avatar safe multi-sig that has the uh nosis rolls modifier on
17:38
it um so what they're doing there is they're adding whitelisted strategies that they'll use in their management
17:44
strategy and that uh a avatar safe is going to have the same configuration as
17:50
the Dow treasury safe that we have um but uh Kaki is going to be able to
17:57
manage within that sandbox within those Whit listed strategies they'll be able to move funds around without getting
18:03
signatures from everybody so it's a permission system um where they're allowed to do certain things uh but you
18:10
restrict it based on that Whit listed permission so we're going through and getting that set up um making sure that
18:16
everything checks out verifying the Whit listed strategies uh our engineering team is currently working with carp2 to
18:23
Whit list strategies within the Nexus mutour protocol as well for staking and
18:28
delegating um and everything and to have the ability to use e to Mint nxm in the
18:36
future if we have investment returns and want to convert that back into nxm so they're working on getting onboarded um
18:43
if you missed this proposal carpat is going to be managing a total of 6.5 million in Dow treasury assets their
18:50
proposal included the following mandates to diversify out of nxm into eth and eth derivatives for a total of $2 million
18:57
diversify out of nxm into stable coins for $1.5 million and to manage a total
19:02
of 3 million in W nxm and nxm to generate yield for their services
19:08
they'll charge a 0.5% management fee that's going to be charged in nxm or W
19:14
nxm and collected monthly installments this will be a 05% fee of the net asset
19:21
value um of the Assets in the treasury and it's going to consider the asset prices at the end of the month uh
19:28
they're also going to Levy a 20% performance fee on the yield generated over the last month and that'll also be
19:34
charged in nxm or W nxm in monthly installments so once they're onboarded
19:39
and they begin to manage the Dow treasury uh we'll share an update keep an eye out for their reporting on the
19:44
Forum in the coming month as well um the investment committee has also published their July newsletter which highlighted
19:50
the Capital Pools outflows and the investment performance during the month of July in July the mutual saw a 1.6%
19:57
reduction in the capital pool which again is largely due to Ram redemptions these withdrawals have continued to slow
20:04
down pretty rapidly so there is 1.8k eth that was redeemed in July compared to
20:10
2.3k eth redeemed in June and 2.8k eth that was redeemed in May so this is
20:16
indicating a decreasing number of tokens wishing to exit there has been a small positive uh FX impact as a result of
20:23
stable coin Holdings due to the slight drop in the eth price as well as very good results from cover fees and
20:29
investment Holdings the active staking Investments yielded between 2.8% and 99.3% apy the high yield on the Rocka
20:38
pool portion is a result of an anomalous deviation in the eth r e exchange rate at the end of July the impact of which
20:45
is likely to be reversed in the following months the a usdc debt position collateralized by eth produced
20:52
a net apy of 1.1% on the eth that we have in AV V3 uh the capital pool
20:59
overall earned 3.2% apy based on the capital pool value over the course of
21:05
the month of July the higher than average result was driven mainly by the re exchange rate other updates from the
21:11
investment committee the first St eth to eth div investment transactions have been completed at the end of August with
21:18
the help of the Foundation Engineering team totaling 4,393 sth um they're working on documentation
21:26
for future transactions as well this is to ensure that there's enough liquidity in the RAM for redemptions and to make
21:32
sure that we can pay any potential claims that come up in the future the stake wise chorus one and ether five
21:38
proposals have been implemented in the enzyme Vault so the Vault now holds 1,515 rapy eth and 4,989 eth has been
21:47
deposited with chorus 1 we're also working with enzyme and Shain link to incorporate the ungoing unclaimed
21:53
rewards from the e state with Kiln into the nxm Ty Oracle
21:59
uh an nmpi 227 the proposed framework for repaying the a usdc loan has been
22:05
approved and so far there's been several repayments that have been made that debt is now down to 5.5 million um from the
22:12
original six million loan that was taken out the process for making repayments and collateral topups if required has
22:18
been documented for future actions as well and then I wanted to provide an updates on the community staking pool so
22:26
in May of 2024 there was a vote um members voted to create the community staking pool there was an old proposal
22:33
when the mutual did a buyback of wxm back in uh late 2021 early 2022 and
22:40
there was a portion of wxm that was bought back and so members voted on what to do with it one of the outcomes was
22:47
staking um some of that nxm within the protocol the open up capacity and then earn yield on the nxm so um this
22:55
proposal this nmdp 5 was results of that past proposal so
23:02
57,6 nxm was State and delegated from the Dow treasury to the community staking pool where it's used to
23:08
underwrite cover and earn the Dow Treasury and XM rewards so I just posted
23:13
a bu um an update it's the first of many bi-weekly updates that I'll be posting on pool 23's exposure and performance
23:20
you can find that on the Forum um we've initially Stak 30,000 nxm and delegated
23:26
that to pool 23 um the remaining nxm that's held in the community pool
23:31
multi-sig is earmarked for staking and has been set aside to support other staking pools that need help with
23:36
initial bootstrapping like open covers pool 8 so the community staking pool delegated 3,000 nxm to pool 8 to support
23:43
the launch of open cover transaction cover a new cover product that is designed to provide short-term coverage
23:48
for request Finance users and this cover product can be um applied for other
23:54
wallet providers in the future as well but open cover has been um they developed transaction cover and they've
24:00
been selling quite a bit of that to date um I think they're going to be working on some marketing announcements this
24:06
week as well around the request Finance deal so keep an eye out for that for the exposure um you can see the exposure
24:12
listed outs the current exposure across the community staking pool is about 4.77
24:17
million in active cover across the listings that we've outlined the top five listings by exposure are a V3
24:25
protocol cover for 1.11 million dialectic moonphase fund portfolio cover
24:30
for a little over a million dollar in exposure dialectic chronograph fund portfolio cover for about $671,000 in
24:39
exposure hyper liquid protocol cover for 424,000 in exposure and Pendle protocol
24:45
cover for $344,000 in exposure nxm rewards uh the
24:52
community S Pool has earned 53.0 7 nxm or uh roughly $27,000 in staking rewards
25:00
and 52.5 N nxm in management rewards which is around
25:05
$2,800 So currently pool 23's active cover has netted the pool
25:10
$2,914 in premiums which are streaming as nxm rewards over each covers cover
25:15
period the leading five listings that have generated the most premium for pool 23 are the two dialectic deals pendo
25:22
protocol cover AV V3 protocol cover and Hyper liquid protocol cover so you can see a breakdown down of that as well um
25:30
I put some updates there too that the community scking pool is underwriting a portion of the Bas defi pass cover
25:35
listing as well um so as that product launches and we see volumes coming in
25:41
through there we can expect more yield to be generated by the community staking pool um I'm going to be posting updates
25:47
for pool 23 on the Forum every couple of weeks keeping ey out for those updates uh I'll also provide summaries on our
25:53
community calls um I'll do the same for my the pool that I managed personally pool 2 to um in hopes that some other
26:00
pool managers can also post updates on exposure and everything to give uh delegates or people who are interested
26:05
in looking at the mutal exposure a little bit more detail on the Forum over time um so those are the updates I have
26:12
on the governance side I am going to throw things back to Sam to provide an
26:17
overview of the last week in cover sales Sam thanks Brave and thanks
26:26
you let's look at the last week in numbers at Nexus Mutual in the past week
26:32
Nexus Mutual members sold $3.4 Million worth of cover and members earned more
26:39
than $155,000 in piece the weighted average XPR period for these covers is
26:45
21 days total active cover stands at 73.6 million across various cover types
26:54
including bundled protocol cover protocol cover and fund portfolio cover and staking pools like the community
27:01
staking pool Braves and Hughes staking pools you can explore all this data on
27:08
the Dow maintained covers data dashboard on Dune and also check out the weekly
27:15
digests at the Nexus Mutual Forum I'd like to also highlight that
27:22
the retail Mutual which operates under our partnership with inshare renewed
27:27
their covered this week contributing $3.1 million in cover
27:34
sold that is the weekend numbers stay tuned for more
27:42
updates next up I want to touch on the covering defi series as you might have
27:47
seen in the latest issue of the Hedge our monthly newsletter we have been
27:54
interviewing thei Builders Security Experts and protocol teams to Foster
27:59
discussions across the space earlier this year and to plan our next season we
28:07
ran a short survey on X to get feedback on who you would want us to hear uh to
28:14
to host at future episodes and most of the respondents voted for more
28:21
