hello everybody and welcome to this week's Community call we hold our community calls with
0:12
the Nexus Mutual community on a bi-weekly basis talk about the state of defi in yields and risk review the
0:19
latest listings on the Nexus Mutual UI and open cover and talk about updates
0:24
from governance and Foundation let's kick things off with
Agenda
0:30
Brave New defi Brave how is the state of defi these days take it
State of DeFi
0:37
away yeah good morning everyone I'll provide an overview of the current
0:43
market and the yield environment in defi markets before we get into some of the other updates
0:48
today um for the last few weeks you know we've been in a slump across the market but with recent news of the impending e
0:55
ETFs one approvals and some other macro events um we've seen renewed bullish
1:01
sentiment uh within crypto markets so BTC and E funding rates are still in the
1:06
high single digits with funding rates in some markets rising over 10% um but it's pretty clear that Athena's growth has
1:12
definitely dampened eth funding rates I would still project that these are going to start Rising as we see further
1:18
confirmation on the uh eth ETF S1 approvals uh bullish sentiment always
1:26
brings with a demand for leverage which is tends to be the rising tide that lifts yields across defi current demand
1:33
for leverage across lending markets is still limited with the average yield uh for Lending on defi lending protocols
1:40
hovering around 5% according to defi Lama and 5.31% according to Vault FYI on
1:47
average uh but there's still really great yield opportunities out there and we've seen an increase in cover buys for
1:53
the ethery liquid ealt a V3 Pendle the
1:58
Iger L igen layer ether bundle the IG layer ethery Pendle bundle um some of
2:04
the moro Blue Products ether uh extra aerodrone spark protocol Camelot
2:09
notional B3 and then some others but those were all the largest cover buys we've seen in the last
2:15
month um and we have some um some new listings that we'll review today as well
2:22
uh we've been working with balance on co-marketing for their leverage vaults on arbitrum because they've got their
2:29
arbs point program uh ARB points program where they're Distributing um ARB tokens
2:35
for people using their leverage vaults uh that's they've seen growth on notional there and the yields are still
2:42
pretty high over there so if you haven't seen some of those tweets I would check out those updates um but yeah notional
2:47
is doing a pretty great job of scaling things in arbitrum um on the risk side there's actually an ongoing exploit on lii
2:55
powered applications so for those of you who aren't familiar with lii it is a bridging protocol that provides uh
3:02
bridging API that allows people to bridge across networks and also swap assets before or after they Bridge
3:08
assets so users that have granted infinite approvals for assets should definitely check out the updates from
3:14
linei and revie revoke their approvals as soon as possible uh it's unclear what the total impact will be but reports to
3:21
date indicate losses of 10 million or more um there's been some analysis but the root cause is still unclear it does
3:28
look like it's related to some of the contracts um that handle swapping before
3:34
bridging so I think there was some arbitrary calls that didn't have um
3:40
didn't have the necessary checks to prevent somebody else from calling those so I imagine it'll be a postmortem but
3:47
um some reports indicate that this might be a similar vulnerability that they suffered from either last year or the
3:53
year before but um that's not confirmed yet so I'll wait for the official postmortem to share more details on that
4:00
but that's not something that we cover because we don't currently offer uh any coverage for bridge protocols at the
4:07
moment um you can refer to that lii tweet which includes those contracts if you did Grant infinite approval for any
4:14
assets on lifi um I've Shar that in the security alerts Channel and the Nexus Mutual Discord but you can also find
4:19
that um by going to the lii protocol account on X we've also seen some av3
4:26
Forks exploited in the last month which follows on from other Fork exploits we've seen this year like the seone
4:32
finance exploit that occurred in May so just another reminder to be careful when using forks and when you can look to see
4:38
if that protocol is listed on Nexus mut or open cover uh you can definitely ask people who did and did not purchase
4:44
cover in the last several years and I think they'll all tell you that it was definitely worth it especially those that did purchase coverage I know a lot
4:50
of people have told me that they wish they would have bought coverage for some of the exploits that we covered here in
4:55
recent years uh but with that I'm going to jump into a review of the new listings we've added since our last
New Listings
5:01
Community call on the last call we reviewed quite a few new listings um
5:07
this week we've added eight listings here the last two weeks since we last spoke you can now buy protocol cover for
5:15
inverse finances firm Market which is their fixed rate lending Market um it's
5:21
on ethereum you can also buy protocol cover for their s DOA staking contract
5:27
where you can stake DOA and that earns yield from fees that come from The Firm lending markets um the estola contract
5:34
functions in a similar way that maker Dow's s die does so the estola uh cover is priced relatively low
5:42
we've also added a protocol cover for Curves llama land uh which is curves lending market for CRV USD we've had
5:50
quite a few requests to list Lama land and we've added this listing here in the last week and we've also added a listing
5:56
for Ramsay's exchange which is a DEX on arbitrum that operates in a pretty similar way to valdrome and Aerodrome um
6:04
so all of those protocol cover listings are live in the Nexus Mutual UI and I believe that open cover has added those
6:10
to their interface as well we've also added some more bundle protocol cover listings some of which to support
6:18
beefy's concentrated liquidity manager vaults for the beefy CLM uh vaults we've
6:24
added the following bundles the B CLM and vrone bundle the CLM and a Drome CLM
6:30
and Camelot and CLM and pancake swap bundles this covers as far as I'm aware
6:36
all of the current CLM vaults that beefy is running um you can find those in rui
6:42
and I know that open cover just this morning has added all of those to their UI as well so you can buy coverage for
6:49
those beefy vaults if you're depositing assets into beefy's concentrated liquidity manager um you can buy those
6:55
through open cover or through Nexus mutual and we also have that original listing that we added um a while ago for
7:03
the B CLM bundle that includes Unis swap B3 which is also on open cover and the Nexus Mutual UI and last but not least
7:11
we've added another bundle protocol cover listing for the newest eify liquid vaults the ethery liquid King Carrick
7:17
King Carrick LRT Vault so you can now buy bundle cover to
7:23
protect to against risk across all the protocols used in the king Carrick LRT vaults on ethery we're going to be
7:29
announcing these listings on X and Discord uh in the next week or so so keep an eye out for those updates and
7:35
co-marketing campaigns we're also working with open cover to ensure that all of these new listings get updated in
7:41
their UI as well and as always if you have a listing that you'd like to see us review just ask us to review that uh
7:49
potential new listing you can send me a DM on X you can reach out to me on the Nexus Mutual Discord server or you can
7:55
send us a message through the contact form on the Nexus Mutual website um I also wanted to move on and
Governance Updates
8:02
talk about some governance updates so there's currently quite a bit of activity on the Forum and I wanted to highlight some recent proposals
8:10
that um either went on chain for a vote or will be heading on chain for a votes
8:16
this week so we have one nmdp to discuss as well and I'll jump right into the
8:22
latest governance updates for the mutual so starting with nmip 225 which is the
8:28
divestment framework this proposal was raised by the investment committee and it went up for vote last week which was
8:34
approved with 297,000 nxm voting in favor of the proposal and the ab signaling their
8:41
approval on the technical details the divestment framework was put forward by the investment committee and outlines a
8:46
framework to keep a Target amount of eth and stable coin Assets in the capital pool the target that's defined in nmip
8:53
225 is 1 million in stable coins and 12,500 in eth uh this is to ensure that
9:00
the mutual maintains these Target levels um and members have granted the investment committee and the ab approval
9:07
to convert the mutuals stth and reth assets back to Ethan the capital pool should the mutual approach these Target
9:14
levels to ensure we have enough Capital to pay any claims that come through and that we have enough eth liquidity to
9:20
ensure Ram redemptions can continue for more details on the divestment framework
9:25
and nmpi 225 you can see that proposal on the Forum
9:30
we also have two more proposals that are going to transition to unchain votes on Thursday this week the first one is nmpi
9:38
226 which is the av3 loan repayment and liquidation policy the investment
9:43
committee has proposed a framework for repaying the covery Associated AV V3 Loan in addition they have proposed a
9:51
collateral framework to ensure the mutual tops up are e collateral should e prices drop below certain levels the
9:57
high level proposed Act for this framework are repaying portions of the loan when EXs stable coins in the
10:04
capital pool are above that minimum Capital threshold which was defined as 1 million in stables in the divestment
10:10
framework um so any stable coin Holdings over a million if this is approved will be used to repay the av3 loan according
10:17
to this framework um for the collateral framework this would top up the a e we
10:25
collateral using 3,000 e in the cap Capital pool at each of the following eth USD price thresholds so if eth
10:33
dropped down to $1,600 we would add 3,000 eth as collateral if it dropped down from there
10:40
to $1,250 we'd add another 3,000 eth as collateral and if it dropped down to a
10:46
th000 another 3,000 e in collateral would be added um so you can see that on
10:52
the Forum as well and then the last high level proposed actions are giving the ab
10:57
approval to X execute an emergency repayment at the discretion of the ab if
11:03
the ethusd price drops below $500 so the investment committee also
11:08
goes into great detail on the background of the loan the repayment process the collateral topup process exposure limits
11:14
as well as other technical details you can review the full details of the proposal on the Forum ahead of the
11:19
onchain vote on Thursday the other nmip that's going to vote on Thursday is n
11:26
nmip 227 which is the investment proposal to allocate
11:32
6575 eth to chorus one and ethery so this proposal is a followup from the two
11:38
rfc's that were put forward by the avangard enzyme team and the ethery team
11:43
the investment committee put together a joint proposal which uses the allocation split that members signaled support for
11:49
in the previous snapshot signaling vote that took place at the end of the RFC review process the investment Community
11:56
is proposing an allocation of 4,9 89 eth to chorus 1 via statewise V3 and
12:04
1,586 E to ethery by acquiring wrapped e
12:09
this would be done using the remaining idle we held in the mutuals enzyme bolts this doesn't require any support from
12:14
the foundation engineering team as the Avon Guard team will execute the allocations on behalf of the mutual in
12:19
our nzm vault using these Whit list strategies if members approve this proposal when it goes to vote on
12:25
Thursday then members can expect these Investments to generate roughly
12:31
3.6% perom on the chorus 1 stake wise V3 portion and roughly 3% perum um plus uh
12:39
any rewards from points on the wrapped e e portion so these Investments have a
12:44
risk profile that's in line with the investment philosophy that the IC has laid out and similar to they're very
12:50
similar to the E staking Investments that we already have in the capital pool namely the stth the r eth and the eth
12:55
that stake through Kiln you can see this n mpip on the forum for more detail and you can review the previous rfc's for a
13:02
review of the fees associated with enzyme stake wise chorus one and The Ether five platforms uh and again both
13:09
of these votes are going to be going on chain on Thursday so keep an eye out for those announcements um nmdp 7 is the Dow
13:18
funding proposal so this is a dow treasury proposal that's currently on the Forum it's transitioning from an RFC
13:25
to a Nexus Mutual Dow proposal and this is the Q3 and Q4
13:30
2024 Dow teams budget request proposal so this has the priorities for Q3 and Q4
13:36
and it is a 12-month budget request for the active Dow teams um again live on
13:42
the Forum so you can review I'll go through a brief summary so this proposal is going to be open for review from
13:49
today the 16th until the 24th of July and after that time it's going to transition to a snapshot vote the Dow
13:56
teams are requesting 76,500 usdc and
14:01
2,464 wxm for the next 12 months of operations as we outline in The Proposal
14:06
this includes funding for two part-time contributors six full-time contributors and salary for an additional full-time
14:12
contributor which is likely to be hired for the Dow marketing team as well as marketing and operational expenses for
14:19
the teams um we've hired a few more people on on the Dow teams and so that's reflected in this budget request so in
14:26
this proposal we outline our priorities for the active teams for the next 6 months um we'll be still providing
14:33
priorities on a six-month basis uh this will just be a 12-month funding request and we recap our performance over the
14:40
last six months based on our previous priorities as well as we work to grow cover sales we expect to offset the
14:46
majority of this spend from the treasury so if cover sales continue at current rates commissions generated from cover
14:52
sales should offset about 2/3 of this funding request if the mutual is successful in further growing our cover
14:58
Sal then we estimate the entire request will be offset by commissions earned from the growth and cover sales you can
15:05
review this proposal over the next 2 weeks and you can find nmdp 7 on the governance forum for review I'm also
15:11
happy to take any questions on any of the governance proposals if anybody has any before we move
15:22
on all right if not then I will hand things off to Hugh so he can give his
15:27
foundation updates Hugh cool yeah no hey hey everyone a few
Updates From The Foundation
15:32
updates from my side um of this fortnite I think um the two kind of big exciting
15:38
things that have um been happening are we've we've launched two new products uh recently um there have been specifically
15:45
tailored products for um for some um specific clients but um excited to share them in a bit of detail and we we'll be
15:52
making a bit more noise about them over over the coming weeks um so the the first one is with
15:59
uh with open cover um we've we've developed a product called transaction cover which the idea being that um if
16:07
you if you conduct a transaction and something goes wrong like you send it to an send some funds or interact with a an
16:13
address that um that is like a fishing address or bugged address or a bug smart
16:19
contract or something like that um then you get covered for the short period of time that um essentially you've um
16:25
interacted with with the contract so it's not like an ongoing coverage that last for for for months but um it's it's
16:32
more of a specific very very shortterm like you know a minute type worth of coverage um and the the whole idea here
16:39
is that um open cover sell it in bulk to um to some wallet providers and and and
16:45
they cover all of their users um so you know it's a it's it's a very interesting product that we're hoping to expand with
16:51
open cover further um in the future um but it's I think it's a really interesting product because it covers a
16:56
bunch of risks that people are worried about Bridge risk um interacting with um
17:02
poor contracts um you know getting fish that type of stuff so it's I think it's a really interesting product that um
17:07
that we're triling to start with but we're looking to expand um once we get comfortable with the trail periods and stuff so um have a lookout for for that
17:14
one that's that's pretty cool um a second one that that's um led to some
17:20
some pretty substantial volumes for us is um the dialectic fund cover so we've
17:25
launched a a new product called fund cover fun portfolio cover with um a
17:32
investment Fund in in the space um dialectic and so they have two funds One
17:38
ebased Fund and one US dollar based fund that they're covering all of their fund activities um so all of the smart
17:44
contract risk um and all of the fund activities that um that they do so it's basically a bulk coverage and they can
17:50
do basically what they would like from a smart contract point of view there are they have to stay heavily within their
17:56
risk framework that they've um that we've kind of agreed with them um but as long as they stay within their risk
18:01
framework then they're free to kind of um interact with smart contracts um as
18:06
they wish and they don't have to buy um one cover for this one cover for that they can just move in and out as as they
18:12
wish and knowing that the the coverage is protected um protecting them um no matter where they're allocating um so
18:19
that's that's pretty that's pretty exciting and really good from as like I guess a ux point of view um and we've
18:24
had a few other funds that are that are kind of interested in this type of thing so that that's been pretty good if you have a look this at the stats it's
18:30
basically about 20 million um dollar worth of cover um and in the order of
18:35
about um 2 million of um cover cost um over over on a yearly basis so they've
18:41
purchased they'll purchase on a monthly basis but um 2 million annualized so that's that's pretty um pretty big um
18:48
Revenue um uplift for the for the mutual so um yeah check that one out on on the
18:53
on the private product pages if you want to have a bit more of a look or um and you can see the details on the
18:58
dashboards as well so yeah so those two those two are pretty big um updates that we've we've gone through recently um the
19:06
other one to just mention and give just a general update on is with re so um
19:12
some of you remember that we've um conducted an investment into re um this
19:18
where we took out the r loan um and we've um sent money into their insur in
19:24
um in Bermuda and and so that's kind of stage one of the deal stage two of the deal is where they are looking to
19:31
retroed or basically transfer risk from a re reinsured into Nexus and they
19:36
started the process um with the the Cayman regulator so yeah in Cayman not ber sorry um the uh the Cayman regulator
19:44
to to get um approval there so um we're kind of helping them in the background
19:49
um with that so and that's you know unsure what the outcome will be um at this stage but um but it's progressing
19:55
um quite well the I guess other things um working heavily through UI updates as
20:02
well so working on on staking um and and um the sign up the kyc process as well
20:08
so kind of slowly releasing um new new components into the new UI which is um
20:13
good to see the new the new UI stuff a lot easier to use than the um than the existing one in a few places so um so
20:20
that that's going to be good especially to get the staking one out um out there for the for the um kind of sters who who
20:26
are heavily involved on in using the app on a day-to-day basis so um I think those are probably the the
20:33
main updates um there's definitely just I guess more broadly um there's definitely other bigger deals that are
20:40
less certain or a bit further out that that we're working on that are quite interesting um and so there's a decent
20:46
pipeline of stuff coming um that um it's quite could be really cool to work on so we're um so we're kind of forming some
20:54
some particular structures um around um some specific deals that um there could be quite material for the mutual in the
21:00
future but um they yeah they're a bit further out and a bit more speculative at this stage but yeah there is lots of interesting things happening and in
21:07
combination with the like usual protocol cover sales and and um fun cover stuff
21:13
where we're looking to kind of expand the stuff that we've got live at the moment but there's also some interesting
21:19
new stuff that's a like you know tailor deals that that's coming as well so um I guess lots of things that the the
21:26
foundation teams are working on at at the moment but yeah happy to take questions on on any of
IC Newsletter
21:35
that all right if there's no questions then I can move on to some highlights from the investment committee
21:42
newsletter thanks you yeah I think there's there's a lot of stuff um that we're working on that's really exciting
21:48
um something that I think we're going to summarize at the end of the Q2 insights report that we're going to go over but I
21:53
think there's a lot a lot of momentum within the mutual so I'm excited to talk about that here in just a bit once I get
21:59
through these newsletter highlights so again before we jump into the Q2 insights report I wanted to recap the
22:06
investment community's latest June newsletter where they share insights surrounding the capital pool and the
22:11
mutuals Investments so in June the capital pool shrunk by 2.1% as a result of continued Ram
22:19
withdrawals though these withdrawals have notably slowed we saw
22:24
2.3k um leave in June instead of 2.8k that we saw leave in May um in June the
22:33
mutual earned 150.2 eth on its Investments which represents a 2.1% apy across all capital
22:42
pool assets over the last month in that newsletter they break down the apy for the specific Investments and how they
22:48
all contributed you can find that in the newsletter uh the investment committee also outlined their priorities which
22:55
include getting NM Pips 225 226 and 227 on chain per voting they're also having
23:01
conversations with the potential service provider who could manage the Dow treasury if these conversations move
23:06
forward you can expect a proposal on the Forum regarding um treasury Management
23:12
in the future uh we'll have updates on that once I hear more from the investment committee investment
23:19
committee is also evaluating their future operations and how they can best contribute in the next 12 months they're
23:26
going to be providing updates on the Forum um as they share more details but basically they're looking at their
23:31
structure how they're going to operate and um you know what some of their focuses are going to be beyond what they
23:37
have in the um in the dial funding request that's on the Forum as well so
23:44
with that I will hand things off to Sam to review the Q2 insights report Sam
Q2 Insights Report
23:50
thanks bra today I'm excited to share the insights from our Q2 report which you
23:57
can find find on the Nexus Mutual governance Forum this quarter has been particularly
24:03
eventful for Nexus mutual and we've seen impressive growth which I will review in
24:10
detail in the second quarter of 2024 the mutual sold over
24:21
$67.95 123% from the first quarter the Serge and cover said is a
24:29
testament to our groing ecosystem and members trust in the Nexus Mutual protocol the mutual earned over 1.2
24:36
million in cover fees during Q2 which is a 2 36% increase from fees earned in
24:46
q1 I will review sales across our core cover product product offerings to
24:52
highlight where we've seen growth in cover Buys in the last quarter now sales for tool cover more than
24:59
doubled from 42 42.4 million in q1 to
25:05
94.8 million in Q2 one of the newest additions to our product portfolio
25:12
bundled protocol cover so considerable growth in sales with $ 49.4 million in
25:19
cover sold which is six 6.5 times higher than bundled protocol cover sales in q1
25:27
bundled protocol cover also brought in the most cover fees out of any other any
25:32
other cover product open cover Nexus mutuals distribution partner on layer 2os saw a
25:41
21% increase in sales facilitating $6.3
25:46
Million worth of cover buys onay Layer Two networks such as optimism and base
25:54
open cover is reaching more retail users and users who don't want to kyc and join
26:00
the mutual as members and the growth efforts are paying
26:05
off in Q2 we saw growth in cover buys from Partners in our ecosystem such as
26:10
Sherlock the retail mutual and licket Collective all of whom have further
26:16
Diversified our risk portfolio and expanded our decentralized risk
26:22
Marketplace the Investments held in the capital pool continued to generate value for members in Q2 the capital pool
26:29
generated 425.31
26:36
43 million in investment earnings currently 65% of the capital pool is
26:43
generating investment returns through e staking yield in Q2 the Dow treasury also saw
26:52
REM remarkable growth in commissions with
26:57
193,00 $67 flowing into the treasury this is a
27:03
269 increase from q1 every time someone buys protocol
27:08
cover bundled protocol cover and select other products in Nexxus Mutual UI a
27:14
commission is directed to the Dow treasury which offsets Dow team's spend
27:20
and helps the mutual become self-sufficient in the long term on April 8th the Foundation
27:28
Engineering team launched a significant UI update to streamline the cover buying
27:34
process enhance the user experience and introduce new Futures like usdc
27:39
denominated cover and email notifications the foundation and our
27:46
teams are committed to sustainable growth through new product development
27:52
and have proposed new initiatives to drive growth in cover sales the recently
27:57
launched Nexus Mutual Granton accelerator program is a $3 million initiative to fund oneoff projects and
28:05
emerging risk businesses with a goal to help the mutual grow cover sales by 10
28:10
times in this year as part of our wider organizational
28:16
Targets in Q2 we've contined to make great strides toward our growth objectives and we have exciting new
28:23
products and improvements on the horizon before we move on to the next section I'd like to ask Brave our proposed head
28:30
of product and risk who helped me complete this report to share his
28:35
perspectives on the last quarter and the future of Nexus Mutual
28:43
Brave thanks yeah I think there's um there's a lot of positives in the Q2
28:50
insights report um for my perspective you know on the product and risk team we've been working to launch new cover
28:55
products to help us scale cover sales bundel protocol cover which we launched at the end of q1 uh has just been
29:01
incredibly popular throughout Q2 and we continue to see demand for bundle cover products I mean that was the largest
29:09
contributor um of cover fees in in all of Q2 was you know what we sold with the
29:14
bundle protocol cover products so uh you know there's been a lot of momentum there we also launched fund portfolio
29:21
cover which Pew highlighted in his update at the end of Q2 and that first cover by um the first cover by has came
29:27
through with the start of July so we expect fund portfolio cover to help us grow sales pretty significantly and uh
29:35
you know the BD team is reaching out to other funds interested in covering their portfolio in a more holistic way uh this
29:42
is generating a lot of revenue for the mutual but it's also adding some pretty sizable commissions to the Dow which
29:49
again helps us offset our spend and become more sustainable over time um I
29:54
think if anything Q2 showed us that there's continued demand to protect us assets across defi whether it's funds
30:00
retail users or anybody in between we sold 372 covers in Q2 which is a
30:06
definite increase from previous quarters open cover has been a massive help in onboarding more retail users and
30:12
creating greater awareness about cover on l2s I think there's a lot more users on l2s so having a distribution partner
30:19
that's active and actively marketing protocol cover in those ecosystems base
30:25
arbitrum optimism polygon um this really really important they've been doing a really great job and I'm really looking
30:31
forward to working with them in the future as well in Q2 we also saw more people interested building new products
30:37
on top of the mutual and the product and risk team is in is in talks with people who reached out to us in Q2 our existing
30:45
active staking pool managers have seen growth in sales and staking yields while our ecosystem Partners have started
30:50
scaling their cover buys as well so if Q2 tells us anything is that the mutual is on the cusp of a major growth spurt
30:57
in terms of cover sales new syndicates launching new Distributors coming on board and new uh deals coming through
31:04
the pipeline so we've got some serious momentum going into Q3 already with our current sales just halfway through the
31:11
month of July already representing 25% of the sales that we did in Q2 in total
31:17
so I think we're on track to beat our past performance um from Q2 and Q3 this
31:22
would be I think the third consecutive quarter that um if we're able to hit those targets that we're going to
31:29
achieve growth that was greater than the previous quarter so 2024 is off to a really good start and I think we're
31:35
going to see the ecosystem and sales grow more in Q3 um I don't believe that I've ever
31:41
been as excited to be a part of Nexus mutual as I am right now and I think that's my high level takeaway from the
31:47
Q2 insights
