going so I wanted to thank everyone for joining us today uh my name is Phil I'm
0:25
with Nexus mutual and I am really excited about hosting today's space alongside my buddy George from open
0:33
cover we'll be getting into the details of the newest groundbreaking product from open cover and Nexus Mutual but I
0:40
want to save the honors of that for our friend Jeremiah here in a minute you can see we have some heavy
0:46
weighs in the base ecosystem on the panel today so let's kick it off by going around and having everyone
0:52
introduce themselves uh could you all tell us a little bit about your backgrounds and what you're building now
0:58
why don't we kick it over to Jeremiah start awesome thanks Phil thanks
1:03
everyone for tuning in I'm Jeremiah co-funder and Co at open cover I've been building in the blockchain space since
1:10
2017 and focusing more specifically on onchain Finance on defi since
1:15
2021 we launched open cover in 2022 it's the first onchain cover broker really so
1:21
we kind of operate similarly to an insurance MGA we essentially help folks stay safe on Chain by building and or
1:28
Distributing cover products which protect against protocol and transaction risk we backed by coinbase
1:34
Ventures nfx Alliance jump and orange Dow and super excited to be here and talk about the base pass today with you
1:43
guys very cool George you want to go next yeah hi pH here everyone um thanks
1:50
so much for being here my name's uh my name's George I'm part of the open cover team and I'm heading up uh growth
1:56
efforts here I'm really excited to be to be here today and um yeah really excited
2:02
to get into the base pass and really dive deeper yeah yeah very cool I think
2:07
this is going to be a really interesting one and a product that a lot of people are going to love uh Ace could you
2:14
introduce yourself he GM everyone uh Ace here from
2:20
Aerodrome and V Drome uh one of the core contributors managing Partnerships and
2:26
Aerodrome is the we call ourselves the economic engine of Base we um
2:33
responsible for about half tvl and the majority of the volume uh going through
2:39
all the various liquidity pools on our decks um we're proud to kind of host
2:45
some of the most productive ecosystem pools across all of defi uh aerodromes
2:51
you know provides the best um swaps and the most volume for wrapped eth uh coinbase BTC which has now become the
2:58
most um actively traded uh wrapped Bitcoin derivative in defi um and yeah
3:06
we're we're H happy to help a lot of the base native protocols and meme coins uh
3:11
grow their liquidity onchain so I'm happy to be here awesome sounds like
3:17
you're staying busy and we'll definitely have uh some questions about how you're handling um all that activity in just a
3:23
little bit uh Jess could you give us a quick introduction uh hi everyone thank you
3:30
for having us here my name is Jess I run the business development at extra uh
3:35
extra is a leverage year farming and lending protocol build on optis in the base um so we let our users to form in
3:42
diverse pools using customized strategy on the landing side users can deposit funds to interest um so all the tokens
3:50
being L outs actually Borrowed by Farmers to perform yo farming so our inry model is based on utilization uh
3:57
with that increased demand for farming our exy the utilization has been maintained a very good level to en that
4:05
which ensures the safety of our users funds and also bring a very competitive and sustainable
4:10
apy uh in addition to what we have already achieved on base we are also working on our exra X which will be a
4:18
landing protocol introduce uh account abstraction for better use experience so
4:24
exciting updates are on the way stay tuned and thanks again for having us very cool thank you for joining us
4:32
and uh last but not least I know him but uh he can introduce himself to everyone else Brave how's it
4:38
going hey everyone it's Brave New defi on the Nexus Mutual main account I'm the head of product of risk over at Nexus
4:45
Mutual I've been contributing to Nexus since 2021 and yeah I'm excited to talk
4:51
with everybody and learn a bit more about the Bas defi pass with everyone and talk about the growth on base so I'm
4:57
ready to get started very cool uh thank you everyone for
5:03
introducing yourselves like I said my name is Phil I head up uh marketing here at Nexus mutual and that means I have
5:08
the privilege of working on some awesome product launches which we are here to talk about today so this one is for
5:16
Jeremiah we're all here to talk about the launch of a totally new product in the defi space Jeremiah could you give
5:22
us a rundown of the Bas def5 pass and what it was like building this out with Nexus
5:27
Mutual absolutely so I'd say the the base pass for short is the combination
5:33
of probably over a year of work with Nexus to create really the best insurance-like product to protect users
5:40
against protocol risk so for the backstory we've been working with Nexus for quite a while um and we started
5:46
Distributing Nexus single product cover so a cover for single protocols on Layer Two about a year ago and that was
5:53
already a sort of meaningful step because as mainstream usage is Shifting to l2s it makes sense to purchase cover
6:00
directly where you have your funds so on l2s directly but from there the the sort of ambition was like can we create a
6:07
single cover that protects users across most if not all of the protocols they use on their favorite l2s and I'm happy
6:14
to report that today the answer is finally yes and that's what the base pass is basically so base pass is the
6:20
first and only Insurance alternative which protects users on deleting Protocols of a given chain on base in
6:27
this case and protects them against hacks and bugs as well as economic events outside of intended protocol
6:34
operation so that will be oracal manipulation or failure liquidation failure and governance takeovers that
6:40
are caused by malicious upgrades to the protocol so in short it's kind of like the ultimate peace of mind that pretty
6:47
much anything that happens with any of your positions across the protocols that are supported by the base pass you get
6:54
your money back there are currently nine supported protocols that's aoer and
7:00
Arcadia beefy compound V3 Moro moonwell overnight and Unis swap V3 and we're
7:07
also including select composed protocols which we're calling sub protocols so that will be for example in the case of
7:13
beefy um pools where there's curve or balancer so it's actually more than nine
7:19
protocols that are being covered um and long story short it's basically this sort of like set and forget uh pretty
7:25
much anything you do on based on the leading protocols you're covered for and the price price is around
7:32
0.35% I think of the covered value per month so it's kind of like a fraction of what you'd pay if you purchase those
7:38
individual covers um one by one and we're we basically um making that
7:46
available directly on opencover so you can head to open cover.com bass if you want to check it out and yeah that's
7:54
about it or actually we U George do we have a link for um for the listeners to try the Bas pack if they want to uh we
8:01
don't right now but I will just spin one up give me a couple of seconds I'll see if I can do something and post something
8:07
in the spaces chat yeah great idea yeah so we'll we'll make sure that um anybody on the spaces can try the base pass for
8:14
free uh we'd love to hear your feedback if you do um that was your first question Phil
8:20
I think the second question was working with Nexus uh that's a great question I would say um absolutely awesome I guess
8:28
in one word um super awesome I'd recommend anyone who wants to build on Nexus to get in touch
8:34
with the team creating and launching the base pass was a super collaborative process obviously we're right at the
8:39
edge of innovation here so it's a lot of sort of different skills that have to come together uh the support from the
8:45
nextus team was Stellar they helped us get initial capacity and overall it's always a pleasure to work with um Brave
8:52
with Phil and the white or Nexus team yeah likewise this has been a
8:58
really great partnership um it's sort of a new sort of partnership for me you know where we're not um you know
9:04
actually invested in each other but it's just really like a win-win where everything aligns and we can help bring
9:09
uh products like this to Market um so speaking of bringing this to Market just a quick followup you know I know it's
9:14
only been live for a few days but what has sort of the early response and feedback been
9:20
like so what we've been seeing publicly is you know folks posting about like oh
9:25
my God finally I was waiting for this um there's a few um few users that we had
9:30
from before launching the base pass we're like oh my God finally I don't need to buy multiple covers so that's
9:35
been awesome we're seeing um we're seeing sales trickle in as well I haven't counted them today but the the
9:42
notifications keep on buzzing so uh overall we literally just launched this so um yeah it it looks super promising
9:48
but it's also in a sense a very sort of obvious product it was just really difficult to to make it happen but with
9:54
the you know joining forces with Nexus we we we managed
10:00
awesome I I'll kick it over to George for the next question thanks buddy really appreciate that yeah it's been
10:07
great um it's been great seeing this um this product come together from from the sidelines and and watching everyone work
10:13
together it's it's been amazing and and this question really I've got is for Braven and Jeremiah um you guys started
10:19
working um on the Bas defi pass over the summer and base with respect to tvl is
10:26
absolutely kind of boomed since then um it's actually recent I think eclipsing arbitrum what do you guys think has been
10:34
driving this this growth yeah I mean from my perspective
10:40
it's really I mean it's the people on this call of course you know Aerodrome I think has just done a tremendous job um
10:47
making you know lping more accessible really their their model has just been a huge success and that's driven a lot of
10:54
supports on base but you know the coinbase team um the Bas team has just been really pushing getting a lot more
11:01
people on Shain and getting more people on the base to get into defi to start
11:06
experimenting so I think there's been a lot of experimentation on Bas that's worked really really well um and
11:12
everybody that's on Bas has been you know improving but year-to date you know base has grown by a factor of five in
11:19
terms of tvl with more active users on base than you know a lot of other l2s so
11:25
it's really exciting to see more people coming on chain and getting um getting the experience of working with Defi and
11:32
getting into this you know new paradigm that all of us have been in for a while so I think that's largely what's Driven
11:37
growth and you know that's kind of why we created this Bas defi pass to help
11:42
people come on chain and participate without worrying um about some of the risks of having coverage that's more flexible but I'll kick it over to
11:49
Jeremiah to give his perspective as well yeah I mean like I think echoing
11:56
you is just number one the builders um obviously you can have a blockchain but if nobody's building on it then you
12:02
pretty much don't have a blockchain um so it's the builders um yeah like everything with respect to sort of us um
12:10
ux like coinbase smart wallet and all of that and I think there's also a big sort of trust element obviously coinbase
12:16
managed to build a great blockchain company despite challenges like regulation and all of that um and so
12:21
there's also sort of no reason why they wouldn't succeed in building a blockchain um Network as well so I think
12:28
that that element of trust is is a good sort of foundation to to bring on sort
12:34
of Builders and um and yeah and have a flourishing e flourishing ecosystem so
12:40
that's that's kind of like why we uh in the very early days um started to be interested by base and and launched on
12:47
base I think on on optimism and based first actually open
12:52
cover thanks guys it's really really good to hear your um both you guys kind of Weighing on that point and I mean
12:59
both from both from a professional perspective working here at open cover and also kind of just personally being
13:05
on on Twitter and engaging in the space myself it's it's just been amazing to see the space grow and um super excited
13:12
for for what we can do next um Phil I'll um I'll pass it back to you for your for
13:17
your next question all right thank you yeah it's been absolutely a wild to see Bas take off and um I think it's been a
13:25
really good sign for the The Wider defi community that you know even when the market might be choppy and going
13:31
sideways you're still seeing um strong adoption you know strong use cases getting built out um so you know going
13:39
back to uh base and the and the Bas defi pass um Jeremiah why do you think that
13:44
this is such an important tool for The Wider based
13:50
Community because it brings peace of mind like if we're telling folks hey you should come on chain it's really cool
13:57
here but then you're also exposing them to all these new risks um unless you're
14:02
sophisticated like most of the people probably on this call and and who've been uh in the space and are still in
14:08
the space um you know like if you're bringing on sort of less crypto native
14:13
non- Crypton native folks it's really difficult to tell them come on chain it's awesome but you also need to like
14:18
learn all this stuff and you know protect yourself actively and being able to say hey uh if you don't want to sort
14:24
of like constantly do your own research and uh you know be super paranoid about security
14:30
um then you know there are options which which allow you to transfer risk which
14:35
allow you to to ensure yourself against um basically most of the things that can go wrong when you use these um these D5
14:42
protocols and so I think that's very very important in a sign that um the blockchain space as a whole is maturing
14:49
because this kind of protection did not exist literally um you know last
14:56
week yeah I I totally agree it's it's about providing people you know a very
15:02
similar experience to what they're used to in the web 2 and traditional Finance world over here in web 3 and a lot of
15:09
this risk protection stuff is people don't even think about it because it just sort of already built in to the
15:14
traditional Finance system through the FDIC deposits um and how everything is sort of regulated you know we don't have
15:20
that background so we kind of have to build that Foundation ourselves to to be able to provide um you know a web three
15:28
experience that is sort of just indistinguishable from web too I think that's when we're going to see more and more people come in when they have that
15:34
piece of mind and they don't have to worry about oh I have to learn a million different things to even interact with
15:40
the blockchain but um we'll we'll let Jeremiah take a break from the hot seat
15:47
for a second here and uh turn our attention over to Ace uh Aerodrome is
15:52
the central trading and liquidity Marketplace on base you've seen your growth and popularity rise right along
15:58
with base what's the secret to keeping up with a rocket
16:03
ship well um I think one of the most obvious things everyone sees with Bas is
16:11
that you know they've got the largest onboarding funnel of any L2 and potentially any blockchain um because of
16:19
their coinbase users um so we kind of saw the
16:25
r on you know which led us to deploy AER Drome um and for those of you who are
16:30
unfamiliar with the the the history and the lore Aerodrome is a uh sister
16:36
protocol of bad Drome which was launched on op mayet in middle of 2022 so we
16:42
realized you know the potential that base um would be bringing not only because of the users but because of all
16:49
of the additional custody assets um from coin basis' institutional side um so air
16:55
drum was a pretty clear you know specific Dex requirement um for the
17:01
ecosystem the other thing is base you know has never shown an intention of
17:07
launching um a token for the L2 and you know this severely constrains kind of
17:14
the boot strapping for new protocols um liquidity and it requires an ecosystem
17:21
specific decks like Aerodrome to really help um you know sustainably grow the
17:26
ecosystem out so um we're pretty proud that we were able to facilitate that um
17:32
base is now the second largest um or sorry I think it's it's now the uh the
17:38
largest layer too um so you know that that shows that air drum has been
17:44
integral to kind of helping um support that rocket ship momentum like you said um you know I think I think we've kind
17:51
of reignited the initial excitement around you know defi summer yield
17:57
farming um we're offering you know a token emission for liquidity providers and and you know
18:04
this is the first time I think we've had an organic kind of Layer Two uh specific yield farm that has been positive some
18:12
um so I think yeah we're we're uh we're seeing kind of the um renewed interest
18:18
and kind of the early Primitives from defi um happen again on base so it's all
18:23
very exciting and I think quite early too it's only been just over 14 months since we w
18:30
yeah it's hard to believe it's only been 14 months I think time moves differently in the D5 space it probably feels like
18:36
five 10 years do [Music] you yeah I
18:42
mean I read a tweet this morning from um somebody in the crypto space and he said
18:48
he's he uh got into crypto when he was 23 and it's been 10,000 years since then
18:54
um so it definitely feels like uh time goes by a lot faster in extremely hyper
19:00
competitive and open Builder environment um but yeah it's uh you know
19:06
it's even surprised us as far as the meteor kind of Rise of tvl and new protocols and liquidity and users and a
19:15
lot of that is thanks to the um support we've received from coinbase and the base Builder side they're they've got an
19:21
awesome devil team they built out some industry-leading wallet infrastructure
19:29
incorporate um a a very seamless and userfriendly way of onboarding you know
19:36
users straight into defi without setting up a you know hot or cold wallet it's just done in the back end with the
19:42
coinbase smart wallet um so it's it's been a it's been a real um I would say
19:48
blessing for our team to to see the ecosystem kind of grow around us we none of us expected this to be as successful
19:54
has been yeah love to hear it um going to kick it over
20:01
to George in just a minute but um just want to let everyone know listening in on the call if you have any sort of questions for any of our panelists uh
20:08
you can start commenting them below or if you're going to want to ask them at the end you can get ready to raise your
20:14
hand in a little bit I have a handful more of questions here to kind of go through um but wanted to let everyone know this is supposed to be interactive
20:20
so can be questions about Bas about building and defi uh can be about the Bas defi pass whatever you want to know
20:28
we have a lot of experts up here so with that I will kick it back to
20:36
George thanks Phil yeah I was just um listening Ace about what you said uh your your friend who got into the space
20:41
when they were 23 and feels like it's been 10,000 years I got into the space when I was 23 I'm 26 now and I found my
20:49
first gray hair a couple of days ago so I can definitely speak to the um the time element there um just before I get
20:57
into my next question I just wanted you guys uh to know that I kind of it would be great for everyone on this call um to
21:03
feel that they can try out the um the Bas def5 pass for free so what we've actually done is we've spun up um we've
21:10
spun up a link and I'm going to post that kind of just underneath uh the spaces in a second but essentially um if
21:16
you want to try it you can head to open cover.com bass and we've opened up a refund link
21:23
which is open cover.com friends and we're happy to refund kind of any on the
21:28
spaces um their first their first cover up to 10K for for 30 days as well um but
21:35
that being said I will just um I'll get straight into my with my with my next question so Jess extra is a hugely
21:43
popular leverag yield strategy in lending protocol on optimism and bass over the last few months Bas has really
21:48
kind of kicked it up a couple of levels did you see this coming um and how sustainable do you think this base boom
21:56
is um that's a great question uh at extra five I think we definitely see it coming as I think Ace kind of mentioned
22:04
a little bit uh we had a similar experience with AER drum as well so the moment we start working with the base
22:09
team we've seen how hardly working and they are very Builder friendly so over the last few months base has also really
22:16
accelerated their marketing moves they brought initiatives such as oning summer which has brought a lot of attention and
22:23
engagement to Bas on top of that I think Bas has also constantly improving their
22:29
transaction speeds um as you may know the fast and low cost transaction are very crucial for def protocols such as
22:34
extra fireos stops one other thing that's also very exciting is the introduction of CB BTC on base uh which
22:43
Bridge Bitcoin liquidity into the ecosystem this will open up a lot more new opportunities for your strategy and
22:49
positions for base to capture a bigger slice of the def Market with more liquidity coming in and faster and
22:55
cheaper transactions B has already laid down a very solid foundation for long-term growth so that will also
23:02
answer the question for sustainability I think Bas is definitely on top of innovation uh like we have seen with CB
23:09
BTC we believe the momentum can absolutely continue the key remaining will be maintaining a developer friendly
23:16
environment and Skilling to meet the gross demands but overall We Believe base has positioned itself very well for
23:22
the future yeah absolutely no I really I really appreciate the response there and
23:27
I think that base being seen at the moment as the leading chain for for Builders is like you've said one of
23:34
those kind of key components that's really allowing things to be sustainable and really bringing um not only new
23:41
Builders um to to the space in general but also also attracting those um those new
23:48
audiences too now what I'm going to do is I've
23:53
kind of got a a question directed for for everyone here so um
23:59
let let's get straight into it so kind of crypto and web3 in general is definitely becoming more mainstream but
24:05
there are still a lot of folks out there that really haven't gotten into defi how do you think we can reach this wider
24:12
adoption um Brave I'll uh I'll pass it over to you to kick
24:17
off yeah so broadly speaking my experience when I talk to people about
24:22
um crypto the Entre economy and defi it's just a lot uh I I think a lot of us
24:29
that have been in the space for a while don't understand some of the challenges of of onboarding new people but uh I
24:35
remember reading along you know a while ago which I guess would be two years ago um everybody's speaking about having
24:40
gray hair is my I have less hair um but I I read that somebody had said it's hard to explain defi because a lot of
24:47
people don't really have a financial background and they don't understand finance that well it's not that's taught
24:52
very well which I think is a pretty apt point so getting onboard in the defi can be a lot for someone but a lot of the
24:59
things that that I see um are because of the headlines we get in the mainstream
25:04
media packs are a pretty widespread thing that gets reported and not a lot
25:10
of the other things so when I talked to people they go what about all that money that people lose and they go no it's
25:16
it's it's different the stuff that you see in the news is much different when people would bring up FTX I'm like it's not defi it's way different so you know
25:24
one of the reasons that we created the Bas defi pass is to give people that blanket to give them confidence to come on chain and participate you know in
25:30
these major protocols and with the protocols that we have included in some Pro protocols you know you're looking at
25:36
about 80 to 85% of the tvl on Bas that would be included in this Bas def5 pass
25:43
so I think it's I think it's a couple things I think it's some of that perception about the risk of being on chain and some of it is just the the
25:49
technology aspect that people aren't used to and getting it you know integrated with some of these Financial
25:55
products that they're not used to using themselves because typically in our you know own lives people are managing money
26:01
for us and it's kind of abstracted away for most of us so I think those are some of the hurdles I think that people have
26:07
done a great job on education I think the Bas team the AER drone team extra
26:12
like everybody that's Building on Base has done an excellent job on boarding people the rise of the coinbase smart
26:18
wallet has been a big help too helping people get in more easily um you know and then you have those pillars like
26:24
Aerodrome is obviously a pillar everyone's building on top of including extra five um and a lot of the other people in the base def by pass so I
26:32
think that you know concerted effort with everybody building and educating people and make it E uh making it easier
26:38
to come onchain and onboard and offboard uh Capital between traditional finance
26:44
and the onchain economy you know has been a leading Factor on what is getting more people onchain but the biggest
26:50
thing I always see is is education and awareness but I think we're kind of on the other side of that bell curve at the
26:56
moment yeah absolutely no I think it's been absolutely great over the last um couple of years but actually the last
27:03
six months in general just to really see such a kind of a step up um in in the amount of folks that are interested and
27:08
and getting involved in in Defi and I think kind of like you said the the coinbase smart wallet initiative and and
27:14
things like um on onchain summer is really really helping that I I think
27:20
what's quite good as well about the um the Bas def5 pass is that for new folks coming on chain it allows that kind of
27:26
set and forget approach um where people know that you know I can interact with these these leading protocols I can
27:33
deploy um I can deploy my funds I can I can have fun and I can be in this space um but I'm also kind of aware of those
27:40
risks and I'm um I'm I'm protecting myself myself from them but um what I'm
27:45
going to do is uh Ace it' be great to be great to kind of get your opinion on this what what do you see is um is
27:52
needed for that wider adoption yeah it's it's interesting
27:57
because as crypto natives we are probably the least trustful group of users of any
28:06
products um and we're you know we make decisions based on data and thirdparty
28:11
experts like Auditors um we read you know blockchain information from
28:16
explorers and the the the protocols who were were
28:22
directly onboarding I would say our our main target um when it comes to onboarding user
28:29
that's where kind of the web to uh brand makes a lot of a big a lot
28:35
of impact um and crypto generally as a brand I would say has
28:43
been 22 catastrophe of the industry so coinbase has a a a very very tall order
28:51
to kind of overcome that perception and they've done an amazing job um so I
28:57
think most most of the credit like um like was previously mentioned
29:02
goes to coinbase and the base team when it comes to bringing in you know you new
29:07
users at the average like $100,000 wallet size um they're the ones who
29:13
actually you know care about um ux and
29:18
um like trust and brand perception so honestly hats off to them um again like
29:25
our focus and I think most of the you know the builders on this space is focus is like how do you ensure you're
29:31
complying with like the standards for um you know the the best building
29:38
approaches to like developing smart contracts um who are you working with on the audit side how many times have you
29:44
been audited um you know are you battle tested and things like that um so it's
29:51
kind of a a a couple pronged approach when it comes to like onboarding um obviously you need the liquidity and the
29:58
the tooling for um the protocols to work but you also have to make sure that you have a a great ecosystem partner that
30:04
can kind of Engage The broader you know retail and public yeah absolutely I I definitely I
30:11
definitely see that I've just been uh kicked out of my George account so I'm I'm speaking I'm speaking on the open
30:17
cover one now but no absolutely I think that um I think bringing these kind of more trafi kind of web 2 safety
30:24
approaches to to the onchain space is definitely something is is moving things forward and ultimately allowing folks to
30:31
have more trust in the space so that's that's something that's been been great to see um I guess Jeremiah it would be
30:38
great to hear kind of your perspective actually building this thing out with Nexus and um kind of with that in mind
30:44
over the last few months what do you think um really is going to help bring more folks on
30:50
chain I mean I think we we've just discussed it it's you know the pillars are better ux education and safety um so
30:58
I think uh there's not much to do except keep on building and the good news is there's a lot of great folks building
31:03
all on all three of those pillars so I think the the future looks bright the the onchain future I suppose looks
31:10
bright absolutely absolutely and Jess it would be great to get your kind of perspective on this as well is there
31:15
anything that we haven't touched on that you really think um could could help we reach that um that wider adoption that
31:22
we're all we're all looking for here
31:35
no worries I think I think uh oh sorry actually I put myself on mute yeah sorry
31:41
I think everybody has yeah has great points and all the same answers and you
31:47
know education is definitely very key I think so for space like this would definitely help you know like tutorials
31:54
Partnerships and campaigns I think that would definitely help like what Bas had in the summer on chain summer I think
32:01
those will definitely help bring a lot more users to understand how def5 works and helps them to build their their
32:07
comfort to be comfortable to get into the space as well as to build their
32:13
trust absolutely absolutely no I couldn't I couldn't agree more and um yeah it's been great it's been great
32:19
kind of hearing everyone weigh in on that point I guess um Phil be great to kick it back to you sure thing um and
32:26
I'll just add on to the uh the adoption conversation you know I really look at this from the lens of marketing because
32:33
that's sort of my background um and you know education is a big thing but it's also just about making that process as
32:41
seamless as possible um I forget the exact stat but when you have to click through multiple pages to actually buy a
32:47
product I think the drop off is like 50% for every extra click you go through so
32:53
if you think about you know what's like a a web to traditional Finance experience like now move that over to
32:58
blockchain we're adding lots of clicks so I think you know it's it's user experience it's education it's a whole
33:05
lot of things that are that are being worked on um and I you know I think it's heading in the right direction um so
33:13
speaking of heading in the right direction you know we're we're not quite at the end of the year yet so it might
33:19
be a little bit early for uh 2025 predictions but um going to go ahead and ask anyway you know where do you guys
33:25
see Defi and in another year anyone want to jump in on that
33:33
first I can try and uh make predictions um since we're seeing a lot of the
33:40
activity kind of come through their pools and you know speaking to a lot of the uh both internal ecosystem and and
33:48
curious um external ecosystem teams so base definitely has the attention of the
33:55
entire space um I think you know salana and base are probably the top two M
34:02
share um chains right now and it's because that's where the activity is that's where the users are
34:08
it's it's you know the best place to get um you know on boarded to to additional
34:15
audiences uh and I think you know from a you can start from like a macro point of view we're seeing um a hint of you know
34:23
like a rate cutting cycle and that's obviously going to be good for defi um
34:28
so typically that leads to higher um interest rate or sorry higher defina
34:35
native yield opportunities if you compare to like a a trafi um you know I
34:41
guess risk-free rates and and that makes things attractive um from like a risk
34:46
adjusted point of view like you you're going to see more people start to to bring their capital
34:53
on good um and I think you know if if I had make a single bold prediction it
34:59
would be like we're sitting at about I don't know almost 3 billion of TBL on
35:04
base and uh getting to 10 billion is likely something we'll see kind of
35:10
middle of 2025 um yeah that's that's kind of my my
35:16
conservative take just a conservative 3x I love
35:25
it anyone else have any uh any itions about where we're going to be in another
35:30
year for Defi and Bas specifically yeah I'll throw my hand in the ring um I definitely agree with with
35:38
what Ace is saying you know with more rate Cuts we should see onchain yields
35:43
kind of increase I think a lot of people are also very focused on the US national debt since a lot of gii is denominated
35:50
in USD that's what most of the major stable coins are not denominated in so as we see those rate cuts and then the
35:57
you know know national debt for the Us increasing I think there's going to be a little bit more volatility in treasury yields so people are going to want to
36:04
come on chain um we should see more Capital come back I think that would be my prediction for
36:09
2025 and with that there'll be greater appetite for borrowing and leverage which tends to drive up yields elsewhere
36:15
more trading activity means higher Dex yields so if we see that kind of Renaissance on chain in in 20125 which
36:22
is kind of what I'm expecting based on you know activity and some of the indicators now that we should see a lot
36:28
more people coming on chain with more activity it kind of means a boom for for all sectors on chain I think that we're
36:35
heading in the right direction for ux so I think with more advancements the C abstraction um you know that should
36:42
bring more people on chain and what I've really liked about what you know Bas has
36:47
done and what other players in this space have done is really highlighted the success stories for onchain markets
36:53
like what are people doing onchain that's impactful outside of just crypto native space highlighting those success
37:00
stories improving ux is going to be beneficial to get people on Shain but also simplifying the experience once
37:06
you're here to make it easy to participate um I think all of us are working on that same experience and I
37:11
think that we're going to see a lot of improvements there I think the other thing that's really remarkable um I think Ace noted on this earlier but with
37:18
CD BTC that launched like I don't like a month and a half ago and cbtc is already
37:24
like a rocket ship taking off very similar to to base growth I think there's going to be a lot more growth in
37:30
CBBC which is going to trickle over to base and help with the increase in TBL on base but I think that there's going
37:36
to be a big Renaissance for um Bitcoin uh D5 I think that we're going to see a
37:42
lot of reaking in the Bitcoin sector I think that's going to grow across l2s and and across mainnet as well so I
37:49
think a lot of those themes are going to come up and become pretty prominent in
37:54
2025 and I'm pretty excited for it I think there's going to be a lot of innovation happening in The Lending
38:00
sector and then continued innovation in the deck sector as well so I think 2025 should be a pretty exciting year for for
38:06
defi onj markets yeah absolutely a lot of uh
38:13
interesting catalysts within the defi space and then sort of also externally like you were talking about um stuff
38:20
lining up for for next year um Jess or open cover you you all have any sort of
38:26
thoughts about uh 2025 for def5 and base uh well I think the the first the
38:34
those two guys have already summarize what we I definitely want to see but I think that we want to add one more point
38:39
I think was what def you know what base has been building I think there was a lot of more marketing movements not only
38:46
we I hope to see more users and more liquidity into the ecosystem I believe there will be a lot more projects going
38:52
to project teams going to join base ecosystem as well
39:00
on my end at a sort of higher level what I'm waiting for I'm not sure it's a 2025 um prediction but hopefully soon is like
39:07
when does self- custody come as default in traditional products like when does
39:12
my Apple pay have a wallet uh by default because I think that's going to be a big turning point
39:18
when folks who are already using all these products suddenly have an option for self- custody and I think the the
39:25
the bridge acquisition by stripe is sort of like kind of a step in that direction where we're really starting to like
39:31
integrate blockchain rails into more traditional Financial applications and so that's kind of what I'm super or like
39:38
personally super looking forward to yeah I think that's going to be huge
39:44
I keep talking about you know the invisibility of web 3 but I think you know that's how you're going to see
39:49
really Mass adoption is when you know big companies are are finding these use use cases for blockchain and integrating
39:55
it in a way where people might not even know that they're interacting with an apple wallet that they're self- custody
40:02
uh different tokens I think that's when you know everyone in their Grandma can be in defi that's another test I I keep
40:08
hearing it's like the grandma test is like when will my grandma be asking me about you know how to to get cover on
40:14
open cover or you know how to deposit on Extra or something like that so I think we're still a few years away from uh the
40:21
grandma test being fulfilled but looks like we're heading in that direction
40:28
um so this is another question kind of in the same vein actually of uh the grandma test I guess is um what's
40:34
something you wish you could do in defi that is still not possible yet and if it's on your road map you
40:41
don't have to to say it but uh is there anything that you wish was out there some sort of functionality a use case um
40:48
something you could do with your tokens that's not possible right now
40:58
I guess I I'm going to start I think one thing we would really love to see in the device space is a truly seamless cross
41:05
chain experience I think we have made a lot of progress with bridging assets cross chains but there's still fractions
41:11
when moving funds and interacting with different protocols on different networks it would be really amazing to
41:17
have a fully integrated system um where our users can access any def protocol on
41:24
diff multiple chains without needing Bridge uh to bridge or switch wallets I think
41:29
that kind of interoperability will really unlock at the next level to for our users to actually uh join the defi
41:39
space yeah I would need that I have like dust and all these different wallets that I forgotten about uh when I was
41:45
bridging from one from one to another so that would be a great tool for me
41:55
yeah any anything else you wish you could do Brave is there anything uh that uh you wish you could do on Def that is
42:02
not possible yet that you're not already working on or maybe you are working on you want to
42:08
share I think there's I mean there are some products that I'm working on I think that are more focused for for
42:13
teams but as as a user I think most of the things that I would like are kind of on the technical side um just talking
42:21
about payments like having you can do this with like no sisay right but I'm based in the US and
42:28
we don't have noses pay here but if I could just have usdc in extraire you
42:35
know some of these protocols that are on base or some other L2 Network and earn yield and then go out and buy breakfast
42:41
or pay for everyday things with those funds in real life like that would be a huge win um and I think something
42:49
similar to that concept is having something that's similar to like a
42:54
savings account that's on chain that works uh like for I have I have a nephew and I
43:00
you know put money in his bank account and then that goes into a CD so it generates some interest for him so when
43:05
he's older he can use that money for school and things like that but if you could do something where you could lock
43:11
up funds on chain um and kind of have the same thing like we have The Primitives for that but I would say not
43:17
a seamless experience for the average user um so if that's something that you could have like an onch savings account
43:24
uh that's powered by some of these underlying protocols um that could be used in the long term I think one of the
43:30
things that we get used to on chain is there's always different iterations of protocols coming in right as soon as um
43:37
you know you have like one instance of a protocol then a couple years later it upgrades you have to migrate funds and this kind of requires manual
43:44
intervention if there was a seamless way to move funds between new iterations um where you don't have to do
43:50
it you have some automated account like an automated Savers account I think that would be huge for me as a user and it
43:56
would also help me on or other people in my life who don't think that you have to be like a rocket scientist to manage
44:02
funds on chain that would be
44:08
huge yeah you said it it's all the cool stuff that the government and Regulators won't let us
44:13
do exactly they don't let us I always say they don't let us have any fun um but I hope that changes here in the next
44:19
couple years yeah I'm surprised there isn't
44:26
sort of like a a crypto Bank out there already where you can have uh you know credit backed by your your crypto
44:32
activity and all this stuff you know it's it's wild how early we still are I'm sure everyone hears that all the
44:38
time we're so early we're so early but if you look at all the functionality across traditional Finance that's not in
44:44
defi yet you realize we really are just sort of starting to scratch the surface of what's possible and there's no reason
44:50
why D can't even be bigger than traditional Finance because it has um more functionality more possibility
44:58
so exciting times ahead um I have one more question before I start letting uh
45:05
everyone kind of wrap it up here um you know everyone here has been building in the D5 space for a few years at least
45:12
what would you go back and tell yourself at the start maybe we'll kick it off with uh
45:20
Jeremiah um so I would the well I did start building the def or the onchain
45:25
space anyway um blockchain space in 2017 and I think uh not launching a token um
45:32
is the advice that we applied with open cover because in the first iteration we did launch a token but we didn't really
45:38
need one um so ask yourself whether you need to launch a token and in fact not
45:45
not having a token does provide a lot of advantages like for example coinbase doesn't have a token and they've fared
45:50
better than a lot of the other sort of exchanges that do um so yeah so I guess you know be like understand the the the
45:59
the big picture about having a token or not yeah that's great advice I think a
46:05
lot of project just launch a token to launch a token and if there isn't sort of like an underlying use case a real
46:11
way that it's adding value you know you see those eventually flame out uh and
46:17
but the ones that do have real value that that sort of capture that they they stay around and they can keep growing
46:23
but it's not a requirement for every web 3 company to have their own token that's for sure uh Jess any advice you would go
46:30
back and kind of give yourself at the start um I think would talk myself to
46:35
stay cous and keep learning the defi space moves so fast there's always something need to
46:41
explore and definitely um by
46:47
BTC yeah that's that's the big one by by BTC by E I mean I learned about this
46:53
back in I think 2013 or 2014 I was in uh in accelerator that was half VR half
46:59
crypto I was on the VR side and I keep joking that if I just invested any money I raised in any money I had in eth at
47:07
the time you probably wouldn't hear me on this space I'd be retired on an island somewhere but uh
47:13
live yeah I think it we're around the same time I heard about it first when I was in the in the states I think that
47:19
was back then it was like a dollar and everybody telling me it was a scam right I think one of my friends actually
47:24
really bought a lot so they they had one each one of them so every kids they had
47:30
they they bought like 10 BTC for them I think they're good for their year yeah that that's awesome that would
47:38
have been great uh Ace any any advice you would go back and give yourself the start other than you know buy
47:50
BTC you're on mute if you're still here if not no problem
47:58
all right K get over to he is there I am dealing with a new fiber
48:04
internet so I apologize um my advice would be to find a good job in web 3 um
48:12
honestly even web two and a half if you want to consider like coinbase or one of the centralized exchanges an opportunity
48:18
um a lot of people who found success speculating in this space have decided to just like quit and do it full-time um
48:26
I was actually included in that group in 2021 I and I decided to uh launch a
48:31
small friends and family fund which fortunately did okay but it was the most stressful um and Sleepless time of my
48:39
life so I would say job security is great find something you're passionate about find a team you enjoy spending
48:45
your time with and um yeah it'll really help kind of you know what what extra I
48:50
I was talking about maintain the passion and focus like you're going to have to be you know up to date on the latest um
48:57
Innovations and and protocols and opportunities so um yeah that that
49:03
that's my advice is just find find employment in web 3 we're going in
49:09
full-time yeah that that's huge I almost quit my job during uh nft run of late
49:15
2020 early 2021 and uh luckily I did not so but it's a lot better to kind of go
49:22
through those ups and downs when you have a firm foundation uh in the space for
49:28
sure George any advice You' go back and uh give yourself I think from my perspective
49:33
it's really been embrace the community more I think when I first uh when I first got involved in the space I saw it
49:40
very much as the wild west and I wasn't aware of just how many awesome people there are out there um and over the last
49:47
couple of years making making friends in the space going to folks for advice um
49:53
sharing learnings things like that has really um is one thing I would have definitely picked up earlier if I could
49:58
go back I was I was a little shy to begin with and I think that um yeah there's some there's some great people
50:05
out there um you you've just got you've just got to talk to them and and find
50:10
out yeah absolutely it's a fun community and you you immediately have like an icebreaker with anyone because we're all
50:17
into the same crazy thing so uh definitely a friendly group and uh if anyone in here you know on the Shire
50:23
side don't be afraid to go out there Network and just you know talk to people it's going to go better than you think
50:29
and last but not least Brave any advice you go back and tell your younger self
50:35
with more hair I think uh professionally speaking um listen to your users and
50:43
have more compassion for people that are just starting out um I think a lot of times when certain people complain uh
50:50
the the reaction is to get kind of defensive or to point them into things but you have to really go outside
50:55
yourself and have a different perspective when you're trying to explain something I used to be an ESL tutor in college and it was like can you
51:02
explain one concept but can you explain it 10 different ways and kind of coming on chain was very simar to that so um
51:07
have more patience um and listen to your users and I think like George said like
51:13
really build up that Community um and you know because that feedback is what gets you a good product I think that's
51:20
what I would really focus on um I will say you know don't be afraid to ask
51:26
questions is the other thing for anybody getting into def um you're not going to bother anybody in in most regards unless
51:32
you're spamming somebody all the time but it's one of the only places I've ever been where you can talk to somebody
51:38
who's the founder of a company and they're like hey what you how can I help you people are very open and very
51:43
welcoming on a personal perspective I think I would uh buy an espresso machine
51:49
earlier and harvest my yield farming rewards on a more regular basis um but from a professional point
51:56
of VI it's definitely listen to your users and and take their feedback to Heart uh because that's incredibly important when you're building a solid
52:03
product yeah I'll second the espresso machine I I did that uh six months ago and I barely have been to a Starbucks
52:10
since so huge huge upgrade um well that
52:15
basically wraps us up I wanted to thank everyone for joining and tuning in today
52:21
thank all of our panelists for coming on uh and speaking with us today um would
52:26
love love to kind of give all of our speakers here a chance to have share any closing thoughts a last minute pitch or
52:33
ask anything that you want uh the audience to hear um maybe we'll kick it off with
52:41
Ace closing thoughts uh I I want to you know obviously thank you guys for
52:47
including us here um and for the work that you guys do for you know defi large
52:55
um I believe like there's been a lot of progress made with you know kind of
53:01
Nexus mutual and open cover when it comes to insurance and and obviously um
53:07
you know some of the things that you guys are doing are essential to bringing this mainstream um closing thoughts I
53:15
still think uh for those who are not in the base trenches or haven't really
53:21
gotten um to get their hands dirty with some of the base protocols really does
53:26
feel like the most organic kind of ecosystem in terms of the quality of
53:32
Builders the dedication of of the teams building to the ecosystem um and the
53:37
real you know onboarding of users so it's worth getting out there um either
53:44
doing some liquidity provision or trading on Aerodrome check out um how you can kind of supercharge your lping
53:50
with extra Finance um and yeah really
53:56
again um so please uh invite me back if you
54:02
ever decide to do this again absolutely we definitely will uh
54:08
Jess any last thoughts or ask for the audience um thank thank you for having
54:15
us for sure um extra we are all about making defi easier and more rewarding uh
54:22
with our year strategy on autism and Bas um so if you guys haven't check it out yet now it's a great time we'll have a
54:29
lot more exciting news to come so stay tuned and let's keep it Building
54:35
Together awesome thank you and then I think Jeremiah will let you take it
54:41
[Music] home cool I actually have a question before um before I do a quick ask Ace
54:48
how did you choose or what was the rationale between or for naming um V
54:54
Drome and Aerodrome like what did you choose those names they sound like frankophone or
55:08
something see he might still be having technical
55:16
difficulties okay then I'll I'll I'll just go to that so yeah so selfishly you know we're very keen to hear as much
55:23
unfiltered feedback about the base pass as possible so if you haven't tried it out already head to open cover.com
55:31
bass um we'd love you to try it we set up a link so you can try it for free and
55:37
then uh if you can reach out with your feedback ideas comments uh that would be awesome you can reach out to me directly
55:44
here on Twitter I'm It's jeremi s or you can join our Discord that you'll find on our website and we'd absolutely love to
55:50
hear the feedback because the products uh we make can only be as good as the feedback that we get from users so um
55:56
thanks for tuning in and uh hope to hear some feedback from you
56:03
guys awesome yeah thank you again everyone for tuning in thank you to all of our panelists um if you're listening
56:09
and you haven't tried out the Bas def5 pass yet definitely go give it a shot this is the the best time to give it a
56:16
