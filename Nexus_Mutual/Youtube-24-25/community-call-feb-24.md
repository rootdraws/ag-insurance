1:07
brave good morning everyone I hope
NMDP #2: DAO Teams' Budget Request is approved
1:10
you're all doing well and are ready for
1:11
some governance highlights this morning
1:13
I'll take some time to summarize the
1:15
snapshot results for nmdp number two on
1:18
the next
1:22
slide so after nearly a month of review
1:25
and discussion the Dow team's funding
1:26
proposal for q1 and Q2 went up for a
1:30
Snapchat vote on the 30th of January the
1:33
vote was open for several days and
1:34
members ended up voting unanimously to
1:36
approve the funding request for
1:39
$153,500 for the next six months of
1:42
funding for the Dow teams I'd like to
1:44
thank everybody who turned up for the
1:45
vote and showed their support um
1:47
everyone contributing within the Dow
1:48
appreciates the support myself included
1:50
we're still very focused on growth and
1:52
cover sales and membership and while R&D
1:55
is focused on firming up some of the
1:56
technical mechanisms within the protocol
1:58
Community team is focused on marketing
2:00
Community engagement education about
2:02
staying safe in Defi and creating
2:04
greater awareness about the mutual I'm
2:06
excited about our upcoming relaunch of
2:08
the NEX Mutual Dow website where we'll
2:10
offer community members a host of new
2:12
resources and guides we'll also have a
2:14
section that provides an overview of
2:16
each Dow team their purpose priorities
2:18
current and past budget requests team
2:20
member bios and compensation information
2:22
and more there will also be a section um
2:26
that the Dow teams can post monthly or
2:28
quarterly updates to keep members
2:30
informed of our progress so you can look
2:33
for some of those updates on the Forum
2:35
over time as well but um we appreciate
2:37
people turning out for the Dow teams
2:39
funding Snapchat vote um we've got a lot
2:42
in the works and I can't wait to launch
2:43
some of these new resources for our
2:46
members moving on to the next slide I
NMDP #3: Add oSnap to the Nexus Mutual Snapshot space is open for voting
2:49
wanted to talk about nmdp number three
2:52
which will open for voting later this
2:53
morning I'll talk more about uma's
2:56
proposal on the next
2:58
slide
3:00
the Snapchat vote for nmdp number three
3:02
will open at 3 pm UTC today and will be
3:05
open for 7 days during that time members
3:08
can review the proposal and vote on
3:09
whether or not the Dow should adopt
3:11
uma's o snap which is tooling built on
3:14
top of safe that would allow the Dow
3:16
treasury snapshot proposals to execute
3:20
permissionless when a vote is approved
3:22
if there's a transaction payload um as
3:25
part of that governance proposal
3:27
essentially osnap brings the same
3:29
functionality it's present in protocols
3:30
that use Governor Alpha and Governor
3:32
Bravo if you're familiar protocols like
3:34
Unis swap or compound um but osnap is
3:37
built on top of safe so this
3:39
functionality can be added to a safe
3:41
multi-sig when a proposal is put up
3:43
somebody can include the transaction
3:45
details and then if a vote is approved o
3:49
snap can optimistically execute after a
3:52
defined period of time which is one of
3:55
the settings that we have in the
3:57
governance proposal so as an example
4:00
when the Dow team submit their next
4:01
funding request in 6 months we can
4:03
specify the amount of nxm required for
4:04
funding in our proposal and if members
4:07
vote to approve our future nmdp osnap
4:10
would allow those funds to flow from the
4:12
Dow treasury to the Dow teams multisig
4:14
36 hours after the Snapchat vote closes
4:18
so if you're not familiar with uma's o
4:20
snap we spoke with the Uma team on
4:22
Twitter spaces last week and reviewed
4:24
their proposal we had a really great
4:26
discussion and myself and the uh and the
4:28
Uma team provided a simplified overview
4:30
of The Proposal you can find the link to
4:33
that Twitter spaces discussion in
4:35
today's call resources you can also find
4:38
that on the Nexus Mutual Twitter account
4:41
as
4:41
well on the next slide I'll talk about
4:44
the specifics of this vote so the actual
4:47
snapshot proposal outlines the o snap
4:49
and snapshot settings as you can see the
4:53
voting Quorum voting period and
4:54
challenge period were all discussed in
4:57
the um RFC phase and that was
5:00
incorporated into the formal proposal
5:02
that Bobby from Uma posted on the Forum
5:06
the vote the voting Quorum is proposed
5:08
to be 50,000 nxm that would be the
5:10
amount required to achieve Quorum for
5:12
any snapshot vote that will move funds
5:13
out of the Dow treasury what that
5:15
essentially means is if there are less
5:17
than 50,000 nxm voting on a dow proposal
5:21
that that proposal would not execute and
5:23
would fail by default the voting period
5:27
is proposed to be 5 days um this minimum
5:30
voting period allows everyone within the
5:32
Dow to review a proposal and participate
5:34
in the vote they can be longer than that
5:37
but that's the proposed minimum voting
5:39
period the challenge period uh is
5:42
proposed to be 36 hours challenge period
5:45
in o snap is the amount of time that
5:47
people have to review the proposal and
5:49
propose a challenge through uma's
5:52
optimistic Oracle if they believe that
5:55
the details in The Proposal do not match
6:00
the um the actual transaction ex uh that
6:04
would be executed so if there is a flaw
6:06
if there's an error or if someone's um
6:08
trying to attack the governance process
6:10
and maliciously withdraw funds through a
6:13
fraudulent governance vote um the um
6:15
osnap integration has the security
6:19
feature in there where the
6:21
Uma um optimistic Oracle can look at
6:24
those details and then Uma stakers can
6:28
vote on that outcome to affirm the uh
6:32
the information so um stakers secure the
6:36
optimistic Oracle by reviewing and
6:38
validating the information that is
6:41
submitted through their optimistic
6:42
Oracle so if there is some kind of
6:45
malicious proposal that can be caught
6:48
and challenged and overwritten within
6:51
the osnap integration the proposed
6:54
snapshot settings which are separate
6:55
from the o snap settings are essentially
6:57
creating a threshold for the of nxm
7:00
needed to put a proposal on the Forum
7:02
this prevents spam and creates some kind
7:04
of a threshold to prevent people from
7:07
putting up elious proposals so the
7:09
proposal validation setting um is
7:13
proposed to
7:14
be 1,000 nxm to post a proposal on
7:17
snapshot this would increase from 10
7:20
nxm um this is the nxm requirement for
7:23
actually putting up a proposal um we
7:26
talked about that amount four on The
7:29
Forum you can see the discussion there
7:32
but um be sure to review this proposal
7:34
and participate in the vote over the
7:36
next week if you have any questions
7:38
please raise them on the Forum or drop
7:39
in Discord and ask we have an
7:41
announcement that's scheduled to go out
7:42
on Twitter and we'll also be sharing an
7:44
announcement on Discord and the Forum
7:47
about the vote once it goes live this
7:50
morning um if there's no questions I'll
7:52
move to the recap of our discussion last
7:55
week with beefy and open cover all on
7:57
the next
Working Together to Protect DeFi Users highlights
7:58
slide
8:00
so last week I joined Jeremiah from open
8:03
cover and wio from BP Finance to talk
8:06
about open cover's recent listing of
8:08
beefy protocol cover on their platform
8:11
um for those of you who aren't familiar
8:12
open cover is a cover aggregator
8:15
distributor that's built on top of Nexus
8:17
mutual and they're working to make cover
8:19
more accessible on ethereum
8:22
l2s uh beefy also integrated open cover
8:26
into the r Vault page view so if you're
8:28
going to deposit in BP protocol and
8:30
you're on a specific Vault page you'll
8:32
see an option to buy cover from open
8:34
cover to protect your position so people
8:37
can purchase beefy cover right when
8:40
they're depositing into one of beefy's
8:41
vaults now which is really great we
8:43
talked about the role of onchain
8:44
coverage in defi how beefy Finance Works
8:47
to keep user safe and what risks wio and
8:50
the rest of the beefy Finance teams is
8:53
the biggest threats to mainstream
8:55
adoption in defi um this basis was
8:58
recorded so you can can list of the
8:59
recording on Twitter which we've shared
9:01
in the call resources for today we'll be
9:03
doing more of these Twitter space events
9:05
with open cover so stay tuned for more
9:07
updates we're also going to be launching
9:09
our own defi interview Series in March
9:12
which we'll focus on staying safe in
9:13
defi if there's a topic you'd love to
9:15
hear us talk about or a team you'd like
9:17
to see us interview please let us know
9:19
on Discord share your thoughts in the
9:21
chat on today's call or join us in voice
9:23
now and let us
9:26
know but if there are no suggestions or
9:29
comments I'll hand things over to Hugh
9:31
to share his weekly update from the
9:33
foundation
Foundation Team Updates
9:37
H um thanks Brave um yeah I think A
9:40
lot's going on at the moment obviously
9:41
from a um overall perspective crypto um
9:45
is getting a lot more attention over
9:47
over the past couple of weeks and months
9:49
um the yields are increasing which kind
9:51
of um especially puts out kind of core
9:54
products protocol cover back in the
9:56
limeline a bit more and we've seen um
9:58
more take up and stuff over the past few
10:00
weeks which is which is really good to
10:01
see um so now we're going to be like
10:04
really focusing on on how we deliver
10:06
that to the most people um possible in
10:09
the best way so focus on the go market
10:10
strategy and all that type of thing so
10:12
um that's kind of broadly what we're
10:14
we're focusing on at the moment um in
10:17
terms of other kind of wider wider
10:19
things that are going on um the dev
10:22
teamer working on um stuff like cover
10:25
edits um and the implementation of some
10:28
of the Investments for the cover deal
10:31
which is um progressing slowly in the
10:33
background we're we're working working
10:35
through stuff on on the legal side of
10:37
things first and once we've signed the
10:38
documents um which should hopefully be
10:41
um relatively soon um then we can start
10:43
the actual implementation um so that
10:45
will put um another chunk of the um
10:47
Capital pull to to work which is will be
10:49
good to see um and then in a later stage
10:52
we'll um we'll start getting into the
10:53
details of what we call the retr session
10:55
deal where where they transfer some risk
10:58
tce um so that's kind of um that's going
11:00
um well but you it's interacting with
11:02
tra so some things do take a little bit
11:03
of time um on the um yeah sorry getting
11:08
back to the engineering stuff so um yeah
11:10
cover edits as I mentioned cover R deal
11:13
implementation um we're also um going
11:16
through um some testing of the the new
11:18
UI so we're doing that internally as a
11:20
team to start with and then we'll be
11:21
looking to roll it out um over I guess
11:24
coming month or something as as we
11:26
finalize things and um and so there's
11:28
quite few um bits and pieces going on um
11:31
with that I think more generally we're
11:33
starting to see a bunch of um I'll guess
11:36
on the growth side we're starting to see
11:38
a bunch of inbound um various different
11:40
things slashing deals coming back so I'm
11:43
getting quite a bit of inbound there
11:45
interestingly getting some um in
11:48
institutional like um inbound um you
11:51
know perhaps have purchased some e
11:54
already but looking to take the next
11:55
step and staking it and then I'm
11:57
concerned about the potential s risk and
11:59
so looking at options there so there's
12:01
definitely an increase in inbound on on
12:03
that side and also a bunch of different
12:06
projects um coming to us you know
12:08
listings and new products and and stuff
12:10
like that so um definitely an increase
12:13
in I guess energy and positivity around
12:15
the space um yields are going up and as
12:17
I said before that's kind of really
12:18
positive for um protocol cover so um so
12:21
that's kind of all looking quite good I
12:23
guess another interesting development
12:25
over the um last um few weeks is where
12:29
you know early stages but we're just we
12:30
are getting an increasing inbound on
12:32
potential new syndicates um popping up
12:34
um some of them I'd say you know kind of
12:36
very early stage and they're kind of
12:37
investigating what options are a
12:39
available um but great to see that
12:41
they're coming to us and working out
12:42
what they can do and what they can build
12:43
on top of of Nexus so you know I would
12:47
nothing imminent there but definitely um
12:49
some interesting conversations starting
12:50
to happen um so you know kind of I guess
12:53
that's kind of linked to the the overall
12:54
Market sentiment so yeah I think um I
12:57
think we're quite well positioned um
12:59
with the you know with the current
13:00
market picking up um but we just need to
13:02
kind of get out there a bit more and and
13:03
make more people aware of us and stuff
13:05
so that's going to be um a big Focus for
13:07
the for the team over over the coming
13:08
weeks and
13:10
months that is probably the main stuff
13:13
um obiously happy to take questions um
13:16
either now or later so um yeah do let me
13:18
know
13:27
thanks
13:29
so if you follow us on Twitter you've
13:31
probably seen our announcement about the
13:33
Twitter spaces event that we have with
13:34
GMX and open cover that we're hosting
13:36
tomorrow open cover recently listed GMX
13:40
and has a promotion going where users
13:41
can buy GMX V2 protocol cover and get
13:44
reimburse for their cover up to $10,000
13:47
per user for the first month of coverage
13:50
we're working with open cover and GMX to
13:52
make coverage more accessible to GMX
13:54
users on arbitr Avalanche and we'll be
13:57
talking about GMX V2 how their team
13:59
views the role of coverage in their
14:01
ecosystem and what they see is the
14:02
biggest emerging risks in defi so set
14:05
yourself a reminder and join us on
14:06
Twitter spaces tomorrow at 6 PM UTC it
14:09
should be a really great conversation
14:11
I'm very much looking forward to talking
14:12
with Jeremiah from open cover and frar
14:15
from
14:17
GMX on the next
New Protocol Cover Listings
14:20
slide I wanted to talk a little about
14:23
some of the newest protocol cover
14:25
listings that we've put up in the next
14:28
Mutual UI this week I'll go over those
14:30
on this
14:32
slide in the last two weeks we've listed
14:34
Maverick which is a novel Dex that is um
14:38
built on l2s and ethereum mainnet and
14:41
equilibria which is a yield Optimizer
14:43
built on top of pendall so far we've
14:45
seen saking pool managers open up
14:47
capacity for all of these protocols from
14:49
a pricing point of view Maverick is
14:51
currently priced at about
14:53
5.2% yields and boosted pools and normal
14:56
pools on Maverick are quite high so
14:58
price compared to available yield is
15:00
quite reasonable right now pendula is
15:02
currently priced at
15:06
5.87% the liquid reaking cze has really
15:08
benefited the uh the Pendle folks easy
15:11
eth RS eth and e e all present High apy
15:17
which come with the trade-off of selling
15:18
your points to yield token buyers
15:20
through the Pendle platform but yields
15:23
are still quite high on pendall um the
15:28
pendo product has created fixed yields
15:31
for some of these liquid reaking token
15:33
holders in the ranges between 20 all the
15:37
way up to 36 37% on eth within the
15:41
pendel markets so it's pretty crazy to
15:43
see the speculation on points but it's
15:45
been really interesting to watch
15:47
equilibria is currently priced at 8.17%
15:50
but it was just listed so that price
15:52
should be coming down to the minimum
15:53
pricing set by pools 2 and 22 which are
15:57
currently underwriting equilibrium
15:59
so there are high apys in equilibria as
16:01
well related both to Maverick and Pendle
16:04
LPS you can look on equilibria but
16:07
equilibria is essentially like um what
16:09
convex is to curve equilibria is the
16:11
pendal so you can check out some of the
16:14
yields that are available on equilibria
16:16
and some of the yield opportunities
16:18
there as well um you can always choose
16:20
to buy cover for any of these protocols
16:22
to protect your positions and make sure
16:25
that a hack doesn't set you back this
16:27
year we be adding more listings next
16:29
week so join us in our next Community
16:30
call for updates on new listings keep an
16:33
eye out on our Twitter account and on
16:34
open covers Twitter for announcements
16:37
about new listings as well if there is a
16:39
protocol that you'd like us to review
16:41
for a listing reach out in Discord I'll
16:43
hand things back to se to present the
16:45
weekly analysis of Carver Sales
16:49
Sam thanks Brave let's look at the last
Last Week in Numbers
16:53
week in cover sales we sold about
16:57
$790,000
16:59
in cover last week and members earned
17:01
more than $10,000 in
17:03
fees and the previous week was a little
17:06
interesting um in the previous week the
17:09
first the second week of February um
17:12
liid Collective and the retail Mutual
17:14
renewed their cover so we had more than
17:16
$1 million in cover
17:19
sales overall February has seen a good
17:22
sales in cover as yield started to
17:24
return to Defi and our partners renewing
17:27
their cover
17:29
and our active cover amount hovered
17:31
around $30
17:33
million you can always review the weekly
17:35
analysis section on the Forum if You'
17:37
like to take a look at the different
17:39
snapshots we have taken from the Doom
17:43
dashboards and ask us any questions if
17:46
you have them on
17:48
Discord let's proceed with the open
17:50
Forum if any member has any questions
17:53
that we that we should be addressing any
17:56
