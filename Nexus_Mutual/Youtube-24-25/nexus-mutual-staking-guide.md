Welcome to the step-by-step guide on
0:08
staking with Nexus Mutual.
0:11
Staking in NXM staking pools allows you
0:14
to earn rewards by locking up NXM tokens
0:17
to help underwrite covers. However,
0:21
staking also comes with risks, including
0:23
potential NXM burns if a claim is
0:26
approved, and your pool is liable for a
0:28
payout. Before you stake, important
0:32
considerations. You earn rewards over
0:35
time. Your NXM generates rewards based
0:38
on how long it remains staked.
0:42
Potential risks. If a claim is approved
0:45
and your pool is liable, a portion of
0:48
your staked NXM may be burned.
0:53
You lock up your stake.
0:56
Your stake is locked within a trench.
0:58
But if you deposit mid trench, your
1:01
lockup period may be shorter. Staking
1:04
managers hold voting power over your
1:06
staked NXM, which can impact withdrawal
1:09
timing.
1:11
You can continue earning rewards by
1:14
extending your stake after your trunch
1:16
expires.
1:20
If you'd like to learn more about
1:22
staking at Nexus Mutual, please check
1:24
out our documentation.
1:28
Now, let's get started with the
1:30
stepbystep guide. Step one, access the
1:34
UI at app.n nexusmutual.io.
1:39
First, go to app.n nexusmutual.io.
1:43
To proceed with staking, you will need
1:45
to connect your wallet and be a member
1:48
of the mutual. Not a member yet? No
1:51
problem. You can still explore staking
1:53
pools and check APYs and more before you
1:58
join us and stake with us.
2:01
Step two, view the list of staking
2:04
pools.
2:05
In the pools section of the UI, you will
2:08
find a list of public staking pools
2:10
where you can deposit your NXM.
2:13
Each pool displays key details.
2:16
annual percentage yield that is based on
2:19
the last 30 days of cover sales minus
2:22
the pool's management fee.
2:25
Delegations are the total amount of NXM
2:29
staked in the pool. Utilization rate is
2:33
a percentage of the pool's staked
2:35
capacity actively underwriting cover
2:38
calculated as total utilized capacity
2:41
divided by the pool's maximum capacity
2:44
across all listings.
2:48
You can sort pools by delegations or APY
2:51
to find the best option for your staking
2:54
strategy.
2:56
You can also check out the documentation
2:58
by following the link to the top right
3:00
of the UI. Step three, review pool
3:05
details.
3:06
To explore more details about a staking
3:09
pool, click view.
3:12
Here you'll find additional key metrics
3:15
including pool leverage and the
3:17
management fee.
3:19
You can also track the APY's performance
3:22
over time.
3:25
Scroll down to see pool allocations, the
3:28
products underwritten by the pool.
3:32
Make sure to review them carefully
3:33
before proceeding.
3:36
To the right of the allocations table,
3:38
you will find staking delegations for
3:40
this pool.
3:43
Step four, review and finalize staking.
3:49
To continue with staking, click stake
3:52
and exam.
3:55
Double check the staking amount and the
3:57
staking period. Because each pool ends
3:59
on a fixed date, you can also prefer to
4:02
jump in late and lock an exam for just
4:05
20 or 30 days. Make sure you read and
4:09
acknowledge the delegation conditions.
4:13
Ensure your wallet is connected and that
4:15
spending is approved for the required
4:18
amount.
4:20
Finally, click stake and delegate to
4:23
confirm the transaction in your wallet.
4:27
That's it. Your delegation is now
4:29
active.
4:31
You can review your delegations anytime
4:34
from the your delegations section on the
4:37
main stake page of the UI. Thanks for
