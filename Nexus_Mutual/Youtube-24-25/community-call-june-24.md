Investment Committee May Report
4:11
Wednesday uh I want to move on and talk
4:13
a little bit about the investment
4:15
committees L this newsletter where they
4:16
provided an overview of the state of the
4:18
capital pool and the mutuals investment
4:19
earnings for the month of May over the
4:21
month of May the capital pool reduced by
4:23
3.4% in E terms largely due to nxm
4:26
redemptions to the ram there was a
4:28
slight decrease in uh e terms just
4:31
value-wise due to the FX impact for the
4:34
mutual stable coin Holdings when e price
4:36
increased from 3,000 to 3,800 you can
4:40
find a breakdown of the capital pool
4:41
flows in the main investment newsletter
4:43
on the Forum the rual also executed the
4:46
first phase of the covery deal in May
4:48
which allocated 12 million in USD to the
4:50
covery investment this investment is
4:52
expected to return about 18% in annual
4:54
returns for the mutual the 12 million
4:57
USC was sourced from existing stable
4:59
coin Holdings an av3 loan that was
5:01
collateralized with 9,340 E from the
5:04
capital pool 6.2 million uh usdc was
5:08
borrowed on av3 per the nmip approving
5:12
the covery deal you can track the av3
5:14
loan by checking the update you provided
5:16
on the covery proposal Post in the Forum
5:19
and over the course of Mone the M the
5:20
mutual earned 134.0 e on investment
5:23
earnings across s re and the state the
5:27
kilm this amounts to a of 1.8% APR for
5:32
the capital pool when sing earnings are
5:34
subtracted from the borrow cost 83 for
5:37
more information on the main report
5:40
check out the investment committee newsl
5:41
on the

5:46
Snapchat siging vote that will open for
5:48
voting on Wednesday June 19th and that
5:51
will be open for voting until Monday
5:53
June 24th members can signal their
5:56
support for the for allocating the 6,00
6:00
585 Idol V held in the neutrals enzyme
6:03
Vault to the chorus chorus one statewise
6:06
V3 Vault and or eies wrapped e both the
6:11
Aline guard and efy teams have posted
6:12
RFC proposals on the Forum outlining why
6:14
members should allocate Le to their
6:17
protocols these posts are complete with
6:19
an overview of the projected earnings
6:20
and apys fees risks and information
6:23
about each protocol over the next week
6:25
members can participate in the snapshot
6:26
s vote to singil support for how they
6:29
mut ate the idol we we're using a
6:31
weighted Vote for This siging vote so
6:33
members can split their voting power
6:34
across both investment strategies for
6:36
example if you had 200 exam and wanted
6:38
to Signal support for a 50% allocation
6:40
to statewise and a 50% allocation to efy
6:44
you could choose to vote with 100 exam
6:46
on each option at the end of the voting
6:48
period we'll use the percentage of
6:50
voting support to determine the final
6:51
allocation split between the two
6:54
strategies which will be included in the
6:56
onchain proposal when the mmpip is put
6:58
onchain for voting in July
7:00
I encourage everyone to review the post
7:01
on the Forum share their thoughts and
7:03
sayal support for their preferred
7:04

Updates From The Foundation
7:31
cool thanks Brave um yeah lots going on
7:33
heaps of different listings and yeah
7:35
check out the governance updates on the
7:37
the investment side of things um really
7:39
happy with how we've come along on the
7:41
investment side over the past I guess 18
7:43
months two years we've um it's now um
7:45
the the Capital Pools almost fully
7:47
allocated so um we'll be close to fully
7:49
allocated after we um have this vote on
7:53
the the idol um e sitting in in enzyme
7:56
so um yeah get get involved have a look
7:59
at the at the proposals and um yeah have
8:01
a vote on on Snapshot um I guess from
8:05
the from the foundation side of things
8:07
lots of different things going on um I
8:09
think the product the product
8:12
development pipeline we've got at the
8:13
moment is actually um really strong
8:15
there's a lot of different things going
8:16
on um we've got um open cover's been
8:20
selling reselling a whole bunch of
8:22
different covers on on L to we're also
8:24
working on some tailored products um
8:26
with them and they're in kind of testing
8:28
phase with some Partners which is which
8:29
is great to see so hopefully they'll um
8:31
start going live in in the in the um
8:34
it's been taking a while to get that
8:36
actually live but um but it's looking
8:37
it's looking good now um we're also um
8:41
developing some specific um tailored um
8:45
products for um some different players
8:47
in in the space can't really say too
8:49
much about it right now but um that's
8:51
looking good hopefully in um in two 3
8:53
weeks time we'll be able to share more
8:55
on that um so there's there's quite a
8:58
few um different products for crypto
9:00
related risks that that are coming out
9:03
um that that we're going to be excited
9:04
to share over the coming weeks and month
9:07
um on the the trm side so the retail
9:09
Mutual um we're going through a bit of a
9:11
renewal phase at the moment um they're
9:13
looking to kind of renew with with Nexus
9:15
for another year um we're just kind of
9:17
finalizing the last few bits and pieces
9:19
but um that's that's looking quite good
9:21
um hopefully we cover a little bit more
9:23
for a little bit um High higher price so
9:26
um that means um pretty pretty happy
9:28
with how things have going and we
9:29
haven't had to pay any claims on the trm
9:32
um the trm deal over the past year so um
9:36
the the claims experience has been has
9:37
been quite positive on that side of
9:38
thing so um so yeah so that's that's
9:41
really positive I think um oh and the
9:44
other bigger update um just to let you
9:46
know on the the cover red deal so um
9:49
stage one um is going to Brave mentioned
9:52
before um stage one which was the
9:54
investment into covery and that's being
9:56
completed and now we're discussing with
9:58
the covery team on stage two which is
10:01
getting uh approval for them to um
10:05
essentially um what's called retroed so
10:08
it's where re insur shifts risk to um to
10:10
someone else and they'll be um they're
10:12
looking to shift risk to Nexus um so
10:14
it'll be it'll take a little while yet
10:16
but we're starting the process there
10:17
with the The Regulators Etc so um
10:20
there's there's quite a few different um
10:23
um deals on new new projects larger
10:25
deals with with big players as an
10:27
example that covery deal the the the
10:29
premium volume there although the cover
10:31
cost will probably it's it's hard to
10:33
tell exactly but it's it could be in the
10:35
$ 7 to10 million range or or even higher
10:38
per year um so so that's that's really
10:41
substantial in terms of um the volumes
10:43
that we've got right now um so looking
10:44
forward to kind of progressing um that
10:47
as well so um I guess on the more kind
10:50
of engineering focused stuff rather than
10:52
just the um the product focused um
10:56
aspects um we've got uh new uis being
11:00
tested for staking and a whole bunch of
11:01
other things so hopefully you'll see
11:03
that um coming out in the um over the
11:06
coming weeks um there few stages to it
11:08
so um there's there's lots of stuff
11:09
going on there um we're also working on
11:12
a few smaller updates that are um needed
11:16
kind the kind of like um backend stuff
11:19
um that we need to um architecture type
11:22
changes that's the best word for it
11:23
architecture changes to um make sure
11:25
that we can um Implement cover edits um
11:28
which are coming along so have to split
11:29
up a few of the contracts to make sure
11:31
that they can um that the new changes
11:33
will fit um and so um we got a few
11:36
things like that happening won't release
11:39
anything on the um feature type side but
11:42
the kind of foundational work that we
11:44
need to need to do um so there's um the
11:47
the team the engineering team is focused
11:49
on um a couple of different things there
11:52
um so yeah lots of lots of progress on
11:54
different items and I think the yields
11:57
the yield environment just in general um
11:59
is obviously it's been a bit lower than
12:01
it has been um over the past couple of
12:04
months but but it's still reasonably
12:06
strong and um there are definitely more
12:07
funds allocating to the space um and and
12:10
looking to get you know they can they
12:13
can get 20 25% on stables and um you
12:16
know 15% on E and stuff so that's that's
12:18
quite um that's quite attractive when
12:20
and when you can take the um smart
12:22
contract risk away so we're seeing a lot
12:23
of inbound there and a lot of questions
12:25
and we're having a lot of discussions
12:26
with different with different people um
12:28
looking to
12:29
understand what the products and stuff
12:31
like that so I think the Direction's
12:32
quite good um and um especially on the
12:36
the product side where we're developing
12:38
a lot of different things and we have
12:40
quite yeah as I said quite a strong um
12:42
pipeline of new products so excited to
12:44
share more actually come online yeah
12:46
over the coming weeks and months so yeah
12:48
that's the main stuff obviously happy to
12:50
take questions um if you have them
OpenCover Sales Growth Update
13:03
okay if there are no questions then I
13:06
will jump in to a brief update on open
13:09
cover sales
13:10
growth uh yeah thank you for the update
13:13
I wanted to share an update on open
13:15
cover which is a Syndicate building on
13:16
top of NEX tool that allows people to
13:19
buy protocol cover on l2s like base
13:21
optimism arbitrum and polygon without uh
13:24
people that buy cover Through open cover
13:25
don't have to go through kyc to become a
13:27
member so it allows more retail users
13:30
and people who are more um worried about
13:34
gas costs to be able to buy cover and
13:36
people who don't want to go through our
13:37
kyc to become a member open cover
13:40
launched in the fall of 2023 and their
13:42
team has been working really hard to
13:43
make protocol cover more accessible to
13:45
retail users on their twos and help
13:47
existing members reduce their gas cost
13:49
for purchase of cover through their
13:50
efforts they've grown cover sales from
13:52
q1 to Q2 in 2024 by over 95% their cover
13:57
fees have also grown um but more
13:59
substantially those cover fees have
14:01
grown by
14:02
194% from q1 to Q2 2024 as well uh in q1
14:07
2024 op cover sold 3 million in cover
14:11
and generated
14:13
$1,561 in cover fees and in Q2 open
14:16
cover has sold 5.87 million in cover and
14:19
generated
14:21
$2,759 in cover fees so far we still got
14:24
a little bit left to go in Q2 so we'll
14:27
be sharing an update uh
14:30
and an overview of their total sales in
14:32
Q2 in our Q2 insights report which will
14:35
be publishing in July I've worked really
14:38
closely with the open cover team and
14:40
they do a really great job they're
14:41
working a lot of co-marketing efforts um
14:43
they're working on a few other things as
14:45
well that we can share in the future and
14:48
they're working really hard to improve
14:49
access to protocol cover and increase
14:51
cover sales from the mutual they're an
14:53
example of how a team can launch a
14:54
staking pool build out their own white
14:56
label platform distribute cover and
14:58
build business on top of Nexus Tool uh
15:01
so keep an eye out on open cover in the
15:02
future if you have any questions about
15:04
open cover you can feel free to ask in
15:06
the NEX Discord but I highly encourage
15:08
you also to jump into the open cover
15:10
Discord and ask any questions you might
15:11
