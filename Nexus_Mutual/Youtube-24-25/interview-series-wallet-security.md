welcome everybody to the first episode of covering defi hosted by Nexus Mutual
0:06
Nexus Mutual is the leading crypto Insurance alternative and the mutual offers protection for smart contract
0:11
risk e slashing and other risks covering defi is a new series of
0:18
interviews where members from the Nexus Mutual da interview key Security Experts Builders and users in defi every year
0:26
billions of dollars are lost due to onchain hacks exploits and scams we hope
0:32
the conversations and the series will help us make defi a safer
0:37
place today we are joined by Justin the CEO of git plus and brave new defi the
0:44
head of the da Community team at Nexus Mutual Brave and Justin will talk about
0:50
the difference between software and Hardware wallets the lce one and how to
0:56
safely self- custody crypto avoid malicious transactions and other scams
1:02
when participating in defi before we get into the wider
1:08
discussion let's go through some introductions Justin can you introduce yourself and tell people a little bit
1:14
about grid plus Hi Sam uh thanks so much for having me on on your first episode uh my name
1:21
is Justin laru I'm the CEO of Hardware wallet manufacturer grid plus um we're
1:27
remote first company but we manufacture all our products and in Austin Texas uh personally I'm based out of Boston in
1:33
the northeastern us and yeah we set out as a company for to be the first
1:38
Hardware wallet designed around actively signing uh with smart contract
1:44
transactions which is not what they were initially designed around um so we were all early ethereum users who were
1:50
obsessed with that ecosystem and we found the existing tooling wasn't adequate for our needs uh so that was
1:56
the impetus behind the idea with a lattice one and uh our mission overall
2:01
which is to be the leader for people uh the leading product for anyone who's actively signing on chain and uh yeah
2:09
we're we're very lucky and excited to be in this uh this particular area I think
2:14
um nothing's good enough out there with security yet and we're we're very lucky to be able
2:19
to U be at the Genesis of kind of a new way of looking at Hardware security and how users will integrate it into their
2:25
daily life so that's me thanks so much for having me thanks Justin um I checked out the grid
2:33
plus lettuce one and and it really has some amazing features which I'm sure will be going over soon but before that
2:41
brave uh can you introduce yourself and share a bit about Nexus Mutual yeah hey everyone my name is
2:48
brave new Defi and I serve as the head of community within the Nexus Mutual da I also work on the product and risk team
2:54
where I manage new product listings and work on product development for those of you who are unfamiliar with Nexus Mutual
3:00
we're an insurance alternative where people can buy cover to protect themselves against Crypton native risks such as smart contract risk and eat
3:06
slashing risk the Mutual has been live on ethereum since 2019 and our members
3:11
have paid more than 18 million to people who have suffered onchain losses to dat um through our covering defi interview
3:19
series we'll be talking with people working on The Cutting Edge of security and protocol development which is why I'm really happy that we have a chance
3:26
to talk with Justin today about the work he and his team are doing over at good
3:33
great thanks Brave let's jump into discussion guys and maybe let's start with the basics
3:41
Justin can you tell us the difference between hot and cold crypto wallets sure so a hot wallet is
3:49
basically the software wallets that we all are used to you know everyone's crypto experience typically begins um
3:55
with a centralized exchange buying a token um you know dipping their toes in
4:00
the water but crypto is all about self- custody and removing these intermediaries and being able to
4:06
interact directly with peers and and protocols um you know putting everything in your own hands so hot wallets are the
4:13
first step there and those are the familiar software extensions like metamask or Rabbi um Phantom and you
4:20
know so many others frame and this is how that is our Gateway for interacting
4:26
with blockchains as users so what makes a hot wallet and a cold wallet separate
4:31
uh different a hot wallet is a software Tool uh everything we do with
4:37
blockchains is based on the idea of private key cryptography meaning you have a secret key that allows you to
4:43
control everything you do and a public key which is your address and you sign with those private Keys uh to do any
4:50
sort of interaction with the blockchain trading on the decks buying nft um so
4:55
with a hot wallet those are stored on your phone or computer it's not really an ideal outcome because while that's very
5:02
convenient um it puts those keys that are your way of securing all your assets
5:08
at risk so that brings into account cold wallets what's the point of a hardware wallet or a cold wallet it's that you're
5:15
taking those keys offchain you are storing them in a secure environment and the two things you get out of a hardware
5:21
wallet or cold storage are critically yeah the keys are not in a general purpose device because you know we're
5:27
using them for everyday things they're not designed for secur um and they can display things that are misleading um so
5:34
you get those keys out of that device but critically also it's about signing meaning that when you use a phone or a
5:40
computer you can't really be assured of what you're looking at because of malware because of um misleading
5:46
websites and and so many other attack factors so the point of a hardware wallet is to say hey this is purpose
5:51
built device and you are able to you know be certain about what you're
5:57
signing um even if your phone or computer is compromised you'll know that
6:03
uh what you see there you can rely on and so the point of these things is to you know a get your keys out of the
6:08
computer and then B to make sure that you're signing what you intend to so you look at metamask and you look at your
6:15
Hardware wallet and you compare the two requests and then if everything's cool uh you know to proceed and you're okay
6:22
so really um Cold Storage is kind of the gold standard for interacting with a
6:27
blockchain every day the original idea there was when we talked about Cold Storage it meant taking everything fully
6:33
offline so you know in the early Bitcoin days we weren't really doing a whole lot
6:38
except for sending from Mount gaau to a hardware wallet and back when you wanted to sell um but that's not how we use
6:45
crypto today you know that was the foundation of it was value transfer but now we use our private keys to sign for
6:51
all kinds of things logins curating an nft collection uh interacting with defi
6:57
protocols and on and on um so we have to have like a more flexible
7:03
device today and that's why I think everybody will see quite a big evolution in that particular segment in the coming
7:10
years so yeah that's the key difference offline versus just keeping those keys that are you the core of every
7:16
interaction you have with the blockchain and how you secure your assets getting them out of the computer because it's just a risky thing to do it's a great
7:23
way to get started um but ultimately it's not a great idea once you start
7:28
having a little bit of value ACR in your account and yet the way that you use a hard wall is still through those tools
7:34
um so you still have the same experience as a metamask or Raby or anything else but you have the added security plugged
7:40
into there um which is what everyone should be doing uh once you get a little more serious and or signing with any
7:48
regularity thanks for the clear explanation Justin and would you mind
7:53
walking us through lettuce one how do you secure users private keys in lettuce one and
8:00
um what are some of the add-on features that you have uh to the regular General
8:06
Cold War wallet op there okay so yeah the lettuce one is
8:12
pretty different looking our current product is a desktop signing device and
8:18
so it has a big screen and what's really different about it initially to people is that form factor but there's a reason
8:25
for it signing with smart contract chains so kind of continuing off the initial points
8:30
uh when the first Hardware wallets were released the way that we were using blockchains was just to transfer value
8:36
so with those two things you you get out of a hardware wallet secure key storage and secure signing you had secure
8:43
signing with that little screen because all you had to do was verify a recipient's address so you check against
8:49
what you see in software and you check that address it seems like a tedious thing but it's critical not just for
8:55
making mistakes um but there is so many different uh vectors you know we're talking about digital Bearer assets so
9:02
it's the the ultimate Honeypot for uh Bad actors and in particular you know even if if you don't have an encrypted
9:08
web connection and you using tour um you know the Privacy protocol at many points
9:14
the the majority of tour nodes were compromised so if you sent a Bitcoin address with a signing transaction over
9:21
tour uh when you weren't using https it would actually replace the address that
9:26
was you were going to be signing with an attacker's address so that's where that verification comes
9:31
into play so now with a lce one with that background the purpose here is to
9:36
show users what they're signing in the most understandable way U so that they can be certain of what they're doing
9:44
that's really important just because you get a second check you know we're moving a lot of value around people have
9:49
incentives to move quickly you know you're menting an nft or doing something with a sense of urgency so being able to
9:55
see what you're doing at a glance is really critical it's not just a good user experience it's good for you know it's it's basic
10:02
security it's what we should all be doing so the latest one is different in that we can break out those transactions
10:07
in a readable way um we have that for ethereum and all the evm chains we've also uh built that for salana and Cosmos
10:14
as well and you'll see that with future Integrations coming this summer and another real pain Point uh that everyone
10:20
encounters uh with both hot wallets and cold wallet is is securely backing up your private Keys you know these are
10:27
again as they're Bearer assets you lose those private Keys you don't have your assets anymore so what do most people do
10:33
they write it down on a slip of paper but that means anybody who can take a photo of that has complete access and
10:40
control over your accounts and all your assets so we did something that's unique in the industry we created a secure
10:47
backup standard um with safe cards they look just like your credit card and they're using similar chips and what it
10:53
does is store a copy of your private keys and an encrypted copy of your seed phrase and that way way you're not stuck
11:01
with a dilemma that everyone encounters with how to back everything up um there's just so many convoluted ways
11:06
that people try to do that to keep themselves safe and they usually tend to put themselves at more risk and uh
11:12
another critical couple of features is that we have physical security included as part of our threat model um many
11:19
Hardware wallets do not so that means if someone took physical possession of your device we have trip wires that would
11:26
erase your private Keys should someone try to reverse engineer the device or extract your keys um that sounds like
11:32
a an esoteric uh you know thing to be worried about um but you can actually see if you go to the sketchier corners
11:39
of the web there's a lot of what's called euphemistically key Recovery Services where you can send them
11:44
Hardware wallets and for 30% of their contents uh they will give you the remainder so that physical security is
11:52
really important we built for a world in which cryptocur currency was systemically important I think we're
11:57
there and this technology is only going to grow in importance and uh the last feature that
12:02
I think is really important is someone who signs every day and wants to keep everything organized and has spun up a
12:08
lot of wallets we're the only Hardware wallet that lets you manage and sign with an unlimited number of seeds so
12:14
that means if you've had a whole bunch of wallets you've spun up over time you don't have to buy a different Hardware wallet for each uh separate seed that
12:21
you're managing you can do it all from one Hub and it's much more convenient you know to have all your wallets linked
12:27
from a hardware device to metamask or rabit or whatever you're using so that's our offering we think we are on the
12:34
right track to best serve how people actually use crypto today you know actively signing it's not just about
12:40
holding and burying something in your backyard anymore these platforms enable so many new possibilities and it's
12:46
really exciting and I interact with the blockchain every day I'm signing constantly on many different chains um
12:53
and uh I feel like this is just the beginning of how this Hardware technology is going to evolve not just
12:59
from our perspective but it's going to change across the industry no one's going to be using USB thumb sticks anymore um we've basically been trying
13:07
to shove a a square peg into a round hole for a very long time using tools that were designed just for
13:13
Bitcoin in a very different world today uh when it comes to crypto and how we use
13:21
crypto thank you Justin lettuce one really does come with a lot of elegant features and it looks quite um beautiful
13:29
as well so um Kudos on that I know you use a lettuce one Brave can you talk
13:36
about how you use your lettuce to custody your crypto yeah absolutely um I will say
13:44
I've been using the latus one is my primary Hardware wallet since when did
13:49
when did grid plus launch Justin so we launched just at uh the
13:55
very tail end of 21 Christmas um and so yeah you were you've been around since the beginning I love it I appreciate the
14:01
support the the products evolve quite a bit since then yeah I've yeah I've been around anyway since early days and I've
14:08
been using it for um for years now and I use my lattice one to you know secure
14:15
most of my wallets it's really convenient again like the safe cards are a really nice way to back up wallets um
14:22
you know you can back up uh you know your seed phase on a couple different safeguards it's uh it's a really nice
14:28
feature but um primarily one of the reasons why I got elius one in the first place is because there was this
14:34
prevalence of um like front ends being compromised for a while right so people
14:39
would go in there would be some vulnerability within or some weakness within Cloud flare where someone's Keys
14:45
within Cloud flare would get compromised somebody was able to basically hijack the the front end for a D5 protocol and
14:51
then when you would go in and interact when you would do an approval transaction to approve a certain amount
14:56
people would be approving an infinite amount of their tokens and that could be drained out um you know by an attacker
15:03
who had taken over the website um and because of this you know if you're looking at the time at like metamask at
15:09
the signature that shows up you know it's all in HEX code um you're looking at something that's not readable you
15:15
know to the to the average person there are some people that can parse like hex but not many people so um if you're
15:22
using something like a ledger you know which is one of the first wallets that I had used um you know it's a tiny little
15:29
screen you can't really see what you're signing right so then at that point you're prone to signing things where you
15:34
don't know what you're signing right so it could be a blind signing attack could be a compromised front end um could be
15:40
somebody swapping out the address because you've got you know um you know
15:45
your computer's compromised and somebody's basically copying out what you're um or replacing on your
15:50
pasteboard the address that you've copied there's a few different attack factors but when I go and sign something
15:56
on my lattice I can actually see what it is that I'm signing I can see the address I'm sending funds to I can see
16:03
the contracts that I'm approving um you know if I'm going to interact with something and I can check those against
16:08
contracts I'm familiar with um so I use it to secure like 80% of my uh of my wallets I
16:17
am a hardware wallet Maxi so I don't really use software wallets while they might be convenient um you know I look
16:23
at software wallets as the equivalent of having like a a wallet in your back pocket right you're not going to to keep
16:29
$20,000 in your wallet walk around town you might keep a few hundred but if you're going to secure a large amount of
16:36
funds you're going to want to have a hardware wallet so um that's primarily
16:41
how I use my lattice again I use it for most everything I mean I manage uh you
16:47
know my my uh membership address for Nexus mutual and I assess risk from Full
16:53
22 um and underwrite risk within the mutual and I use a safe card to secure that address um and there's a lot of
17:00
nice features on the latest one as well that I use all the time one of them is I can go in and I can basically tag
17:06
addresses so if I'm sending funds to another wallet of mine um and I want to put like a nickname in for the wallet I
17:13
can do that if there a contract that I'm interacting with all the time let's say that you're interacting with a certain
17:19
contract address because you're depositing into something like pool together or you're using Unis swap or
17:25
you're using you know a bunch of these things you can actually go in and tag contract addresses and give them like a
17:31
plain English name so you can see what you're signing and on a shorthand you know if I look and say that I'm going to
17:37
send my funds to metallic. eth and I have that tagged in you know my uh my
17:42
good plus um and I go in and I see that it's not that address I know that I've
17:48
messed something up right I know that I've put in the wrong address or I've I've made some mistake and so I know I
17:53
can go back and double check it um so having that screen and be able to see what you're signing has been for me um a
18:00
huge benefit and there's been a couple cases where I was going to sign something I didn't want to and I was able to reject that transaction so it
18:07
was able to keep my fund safe on on a few occasions um so yeah I've been I
18:13
would say a lus one power user and uh a really big advocate for for this Hardware
18:21
wallet thanks for sharing your experience Brave with all the scams we've seen on
18:27
Twitter um and all the malicious transactions people have been prompted to sign due to compromis websites and
18:35
the rise in fishing EMASS for crypto users and all that how does a hardware Wallet help
18:42
protect against these risks Justin um so the critical thing is it
18:49
helps you see at a glance and double check that you're doing what you intend to one way it does that is How brave new
18:55
defi mentioned address tags right if you've tagged an address and you expect to be sending to that same address if
19:03
you suddenly get you know a hex string instead of you know Brave New defi as the label you're going to know something
19:08
is wrong and you're going to not proceed um there's actually been a new attack Vector that sounds really out there like
19:15
it people wouldn't fall for it and it is super common and there's been a ton of funds lost which is called an address
19:21
poisoning attack so they were bought set up and they look for high value accounts
19:26
on evm chains and what they do they generate vanity addresses which means if you look at the your public key you know
19:33
it looks pretty close to it it looks pretty similar has like the same starting hex and maybe the same ending hex as your own personal address and
19:41
what they do is they send uh just like trivial or like nonv value amounts back and forth so it shows up in your
19:47
transaction history um by you know them interacting with your wallet with another wallet that almost looks like
19:52
the same address and what people do um they get into the habit of cutting and pasting from block explorers like ether
19:58
scan so people end up thinking they're sending to themselves or giving someone the right address and they're giving the
20:03
attacker's address away so labels help with that kind of thing um ens the ethereum name service um being able to
20:11
see that it doesn't resolve correctly is something that um will also help keep people safe um that's something we're
20:18
working on with that team right now so Hardware wallets generally don't have reverse resolution uh for ens meaning
20:24
like when you put something in will it look up and apply the right the right ens name the real readable name instead
20:30
of the long hex address um we're working with them on a pretty cool solution for that so that this should all be automated that'll come later this year
20:37
and I think that's a big step forward um the other thing is too sometimes when
20:43
people's phones or computers are compromised um you will have maybe a
20:48
signing request that looks like something different than you intend to sign there have been instances with
20:54
metamask or wallets being compromised and one thing's displayed on screen but what you're really approving with your
20:59
Hardware wallet is something else entirely if you can read it you can know not to proceed um and then the other
21:06
thing is just getting your keys out of a phone or computer is really important uh for example we had someone who used to
21:11
work with us uh he unfortunately was subjected to a wallet drainer attack not
21:17
the typical one like a bad contract interaction what happened was I think he had downloaded pirate software I think it was a PIR copy of Photoshop and
21:25
Premiere and what happened it installed something into his browser a little extension not a malicious one called
21:31
Grease Monkey and it lets um that tool lets you run scripts in the browser and
21:37
what it did basically was the script that was installed with this basically waited for metamask to be left unlocked
21:44
and for the computer to go idle and then what it did was just start transferring assets out automatically because there
21:50
was no second check um it was all on the computer and it just started moving all the funds out of his wallet and there's
21:56
really nothing to be done at that point except you know if it's a high value account pass it on to someone to document it and help label Bad actors
22:04
and help try and keep other people safe um so there are many ways in which the
22:09
hardware wallet you know both by seeing what you're signing and knowing if something's wrong and then also having
22:15
your keys out of an environment where they can be stolen or you can you know have an automated tool that will will
22:21
sign for you um that is a huge way in which it helps um so yeah it's never
22:28
ending arms race because what's more appealing to a bad actor than you know being able to trick people into giving
22:34
you an asset around the world that is a bearer instrument like cash so it will never
22:41
end there's constantly new attack vectors coming out um we hear from people every day which is a rough part
22:47
about working on a wallet people that um were not set up properly or did
22:52
something that even as a sophisticated person they might not have realized was not a good idea and
23:00
it's really always it's pretty sad talking to these people so it's a we know with helping people self- custody their crypto it's a really serious
23:06
responsibility one that we take uh to heart we know how important it is so
23:12
yeah unfortunately I think most people in crypto though they don't really think about these things until something bad
23:18
happens to them or someone close to them and I really wish when people experienced attacks they would talk
23:24
about it more because I know from private conversations and people reaching out to us wondering if we know
23:30
people in law enforcement or people that can investigate what happened everyone kind of needs most
23:37
people in crypto need to touch the stove before they believe it's hot uh which is a really unfortunate thing because it's
23:42
so much more fun using crypto when you have a safety net when you know you can sleep at night and your assets are safe
23:48
and you can still you know ape into all kinds of things mint nfts without thinking and try new you know dgen defi
23:55
protocols uh doing all that is just more fun with that that additional assurance that lets you have peace of mind so yeah
24:03
it's it's never ending but those are big ones we see now another huge one too I want to mention is um malicious airdrops
24:10
so if you go to open C you'll probably see a lot of hidden items on any active wallet and some of those they have a
24:17
couple different things they do some try to entice you to go to a malicious website that might encourage you to sign
24:23
a transaction for a wallet drainer or you to enter your private Keys into the web UI uh alternately yeah sometimes
24:31
just trying to move them and interacting with that contract will have the same
24:36
negative consequences so you know I see very sophisticated people in this space
24:42
all the time get hacked um not hacked I mean not even that their computers are
24:47
compromised but sign things they don't mean to get scammed um a notable uh example of this was vitalic
24:55
buan had his phone ported a couple months ago the first thing the attackers did was put up a an nft mint which was
25:03
actually for a wallet trainer and there was protocol devs who are infinitely smarter than I'll ever be who got
25:09
wrecked by this um because there's just some degree of trust and not thinking about it um so if they don't have a shot
25:17
the people building protocols you know what chance does the average user dipping their toes in so the answer here
25:23
is that along with that that metaphor of a never- ending arms race against Bad actors it is a question of you know we
25:30
need better tooling I think we as an industry always focus on the shiny new thing um everybody you know if you just
25:38
got your PhD in cryptography you're going to want to work with zero knowledge proofs you're not going to work on Basics um but we interact with
25:44
blockchains through the basics your hardware and software wallet are your way of communicating with everything in
25:51
this ecosystem and I actually feel quite frustrated that there's not enough focus on it um there's not enough
25:58
Improvement going on there are some really big signs of Hope um and great new tools coming out but we as an
26:04
industry have to do better um because this is just the fundamental layer that impacts everybody's experience um
26:11
speaking about those Rays of Hope one thing I think it's cool there is a big crop of new teams that are doing
26:17
additional security plugins and they're getting integrated into wallets as well like rabi and metamask that maintain databases of
26:25
malicious contracts and Bad actors and they will give users a warning beforehand so I think that's a really
26:32
important new tool um this even some new teams that are under the radar that are doing things like automatically looking
26:39
at a contract before you interact with it to see even if it's not labeled as a malicious contract or something you
26:45
shouldn't touch just seeing if the the way that it's structured raises red flags if it is a copy of something else
26:52
that is known to be malicious so those Advanced warnings I think are going to help and um I overuse this metaphor but
26:59
we call it the the Swiss Cheese model of security so now you've got U you know improvements in software wallets more
27:05
readable transactions um you have a little bit more clarity with signing now you've got
27:10
these tools that will warn you about bad interactions and you also got Hardware wallets and they're improving and I
27:16
think we've got a long way to go in that front but the idea of the Swiss Cheese model of security is that swiss cheese
27:21
slices are all full of holes but if you stack enough together the holes are not
27:27
going to line up in a way that will be easy to get through all of those layers so that's why I think these new
27:33
malicious you know these Warning Systems for malicious interactions um they're really useful and together with better
27:40
software wallets tools like this and Hardware wallets we're going to get a lot closer to something that is adequate
27:47
for any new user coming in and you know letting them know that they can play and experiment but stay
27:57
safe thank you Justin so many wise words and
28:02
um we often also talk with Brave and The Wider team at Nexus Mutual about usability in dii and how there are many
28:09
issues that needs to be solved so that defi can be adopted by the
28:15
masses thank you if you have stayed with us this long
28:21
dear listeners we are ready to share the poab code to redeem this code you will
28:27
need the poab app app on your phone um to remind you we're giving away one
28:32
lettuce one and we'll share more about the giveaway details but stay with me right now to enter the PO app enter the
28:41
raffle if you have the app you can select mint and then secret word and the
28:48
secret word for today's po app is Safeguard all lcase no spaces safe
28:56
card one you mint the PO app you can enter our raffle today you can find the
29:02
link for today's raffle in the comment section of today's Twitter space as call
29:07
I just shared the comment from my personal
29:13
account those who Min the poap can enter the raffle on PO app. fun one hour after
29:20
the call ends we will run the raffle drawing to determine who from today's call is the lucky winner of a new great
29:28
plus lettuce one Hardware wallet there's only 100 poabs for
29:33
today's call so you have a one in 100 chance to
29:41
win I'm looking forward to learning who the lucky winner will be but right now I want to open the space up for any
29:48
questions from the audience or anything that you'd like to touch upon Brave or
29:57
Justin
30:06
I think I'll just say on on my end um just going back to just the concept of
30:11
like Hardware wallets soptware wallets I think a lot of people that get into crypto don't always understand the
30:18
difference between like a private key and say like a Facebook account so they
30:24
don't understand that when they get their seed phrase for a wallet that it's not something you can share with somebody else you should treat it like
30:30
very sensitive information and one thing about metamask I use metamask all the
30:36
time in combination with the hardware wallet so you can do that you don't expose your private key you're just
30:41
using that that web wallet basically as the interface to connect to different D apps because most things connect with
30:47
metam mask so you're still pairing it with a hardware wallet um but the uh the nice part about that is
30:56
you're not exposing your private key whereas if you're using metamask as your primary wallet right and it's a software
31:03
wallet where the you know the private keys are always online but they're secured by your seed phrase if your seed
31:09
phrase gets compromised all of the addresses in your metamask are going to be compromised and somebody can drain
31:15
all of those so there are people that you know will use one metamask account they'll make multiple um addresses in
31:22
there and use those for different things so if you're separating you know what assets are in what wallets but you're
31:27
doing everything for a metamask you're not really doing yourself any favors so the difference between a hardware wallet
31:33
and a software wallet is is pretty big and when you're talking about you know
31:39
the benefits of using you know a hardware wallet you really want
31:44
something where you can be sure of what you're signing and to be able to you know protect
31:49
against um blind signing attacks and and some of these other things I mean there's been a lot of examples here in
31:55
just the last year Galaxy which is a site that people use for like web 3
32:00
quests um they were briefly compromised they ended up refunding all users who
32:06
are impacted but it was one of those things where you would sign in and it would ask you to sign a message which
32:12
was giving um a contract and approval over some of the tokens in your wallet
32:17
um there are other examples of D5 front ends that have been compromised where again someone is you know getting an
32:23
approval to take tokens out of your accounts there are lot of people that have spun up like clone uh clones of
32:31
popular d d apps so that you're looking at a front end that looks identical to let's say art blocks or identical to
32:38
Unis swap but it's a malicious site and on the back end there's a malicious contract and so if you sign something
32:45
you might be you know um basically giving permission over to a wallet drainer that's then going to take all
32:50
the funds out of your wallet so these things are really important and I definitely agree with Justin that this is kind of like the foundation the
32:57
building block um for people who are looking to cuss the their own funds to be fully on chain
33:06
and to take control of their own funds on chain but doing it in a safe way um
33:13
again I think you can see it almost every day on um on Twitter people talking about
33:20
having their nfts drained um having a lot of these you know things come up where they lose funds so so um it is
33:28
really really important yeah it's I mean it's a never-
33:35
ending thing and what you see publicly is the tip of the iceberg people are kind of embarrassed you know everyone
33:41
wants to present themselves as an expert in the space whether they've been here for 10 years or you know 10 days and
33:49
it's not really a great environment you know one example of this is crypto Twitter um when people lose funds
33:57
there's invariably a bunch of an non accounts that are making fun of that person and you know just joking about them getting wrecked and so it's pretty
34:05
toxic so you know I get why people don't talk about it but if people understood how pervasive these problems are and you
34:12
know the billions of dollars of user funds being lost I think that should change you know
34:18
it's a cultural thing we talk about you know what are the elements here better tooling to make sure that we set up new users for Success um and better
34:27
education but part of its culture too like one of the best things you can have is just someone to reach out to to ask
34:33
questions you know whether it's a Discord you're in for any topic you know nft Community if something looks wrong
34:39
you know run it by other people it's worth taking two minutes to not have your wallet
34:44
drained but you know again uh there's always the sense of urgency created with a lot of scams and a lot of people are
34:52
reticent to actually ever ask questions um because they want to they want to look like you know Chads on Twitter or
34:58
their Discord and that's something that's got to change the most sophisticated people lose money um I
35:05
talked to a protocol founder um who's very visible um who lost everything out
35:12
of one of his wallets recently I don't necessarily we haven't you know root caused it yet uh but to me is shocking
35:20
that's someone who's been involved in the space you know since early Bitcoin days so I think changing that culture and you
35:27
know just telling people you know it's like the equivalent of saying okay it's cool to wear you know a helmet on your
35:33
motorcycle you know everybody should be doing it uh you might like how your hair Flaps in the breeze and it's the same
35:39
with blind signing using hot wallets um over the course of my time I've talked
35:44
to you know a big fund in the space that confessed that they were keeping millions and and uh user assets and just
35:52
metamask and you know it makes me want to jump out of my chair and I have to stay calm about you know there are
35:58
better solutions for these things now we're going to provide better Solutions um but that's the best thing is just you
36:05
know learning good habits double checking uh bookmarking sites you go to you know other attack factors are often
36:12
social right um so for example I'm not I'm not piling on with this but um
36:18
there's been a lot of compromis accounts lately doing these salana pre-sale mins right because everyone's fired up about
36:24
meme coins and getting in first so yesterday the treasure account was compromised and had a fake mint put
36:30
up by an attacker um a friend of mine Scott Lewis had the same um so two
36:36
lessons out of that um a make sure you you lock down your phone so your phone number doesn't get ported and you don't
36:43
don't use um your phone for second Factor authentication for logins use you know Google Authenticator or another
36:49
tool along those lines it's really important because so many people secure things with their phone numbers and uh
36:55
there's been attempts to Port my phone everybody can count it at some point if you use your real name in the space um
37:00
but the other is don't don't click stuff on Twitter like like that um you know there's even been ones that that threw
37:07
me off I remember recently looking at a thread from ethery the the reaking
37:12
protocol and all right interesting thread and then there's a link at the bottom and you know I click through and
37:19
I get all these warnings because I am using these tools like you know fire and wallard that will warn you about malicious sites and I just done it
37:26
absent mindedly I was I want to read the article and go to their site and what people do they take over other Twitter
37:32
accounts or set them up so it looks exactly like the Avatar and they insert themselves at the end of the thread so now you start to see all these threads
37:39
from reaking protocols and dii protocols saying this is the last tweet in the thread because that became so common um
37:47
yeah so the the mints on Twitter I mean anytime you see an address in that context you better be incredibly
37:54
skeptical um you should always retain that healthy sense of skepticism in crypto and assume you know there is
38:01
danger lurking around every corner but you know if you set yourself up right and you learn the right patterns I'm not
38:06
telling people to to be anxious or paranoid if you set yourself UPR right you can have peace of mind and relax and
38:12
enjoy all of this um so it's so it's so much better I just wish I could get
38:17
people as they get on board into the space to take these things seriously because they will have such a better experience um it's always painful that
38:25
like I said when people come to us after something happen happens and they want to be connected to resources you know they tell us they've always used a hot
38:31
wallet and it was always fine um until the day that they had a wallet train or attack so I mean I say you know our
38:38
product isn't the perfect one for everybody out there I love it I use it every day um but that said get any
38:46
hardware wallet I I always tell people if you come to our Discord I'll help you set up a ledger treaser um any product
38:53
out there status key card uh I want you to get your private keys out of your computer out of your phone and just to
39:00
take those initial steps that will make you a little safer and give you some assurance that you're not going to get
39:07
wrecked just going through your day normally and trying to have fun with everything built on blockchains so um I
39:14
guess one other shout out on that is uh grid plus Discord you know we're a small team we're all crypto dorks um there is
39:22
no you know real distinction between the workday and our Hobbies it's just uh
39:28
it's kind of sick it's just crypto all the time we love it uh this is our community our friends are in this community so if you have a question
39:34
about another wallet uh you want to know about if a site looks sketchy if you don't want to sign something come talk
39:40
to us you know we might not be able to get back to you in one minute but we're around and I'm happy to help I'm happy to jump on calls with people and I hope
39:48
within your own communities if you do have this degree of understanding you do that for the other people around you you
39:53
know I can't talk to everybody on the internet um but if you have an nft defi Discord that you're on you know share
40:00
that share your experiences share when something looks sketchy help keep everybody else safe and and share what
40:07
you know and ask questions so um we can all chip in to help make each other
40:12
safer yeah I I completely agree I think scams especially in crypto are prevalent and there's always new ones popping up
40:19
um whether it's on Discord or on Twitter you know people are sending you links and telling you to jump into another
40:25
server for a support ticket which is always a scam or people asking you to confirm your wallet by connecting it to
40:31
something and giving approvals which is also always a scam um there's a lot of things out there that you know people
40:38
are looking for you to give these approvals having a way to protect against that and like see that you're
40:43
basically giving somebody the authority to take money out of your wallet um but I think just broadly speaking when
40:51
you're transacting in crypto um if you're chronically online
40:56
which I I I think I could safely say both Justin and I are chronically online um where crypto is kind of our life most
41:04
of the day unless we're sleeping and even then we're probably thinking about it um you know it kind of just becomes
41:10
this second nature but you get tired sometimes right and um like Justin said
41:16
anything where there's a sense of urgency like hey you have to approve this hey you have to sign this hey you have to do this or this mint window is
41:22
closing in the next you know five hours or whatever it is if something sounds too good to be true and there's a sense
41:29
of urgency it's almost always a scam so just keep an eye out for those things
41:35
there's all kinds of bots now on Twitter um you know Twitter has kind of become untenable and in some areas just because
41:41
there's so much spam that comes up on Twitter um but that'll make its way over into some of these other decentralized
41:48
uh you know social platforms as well so it's about being vigilant and kind of knowing what some of these common scams
41:53
are but more than anything if you are transacting with or storing any amount
41:59
of crypto there's a lot of things you can do you can use a hardware wallet you can use some of these tools like Justin
42:04
had mentioned there's like wallet gard and Florida they have um metamask snaps which is like an extension in your
42:10
metamask you can enable so it gives you alerts if there's this common um like malicious contract or this common attack
42:17
factor that you're about to fall prey to you can use uh wallets like Ravi which
42:22
you can connect a hardware wallet to and if you do that it's going to give you like a hey are sure you want to sign
42:28
this this looks like a scam it'll give you some of these alerts so you know it'll help you out even if you're tired
42:33
and you know and and you're about to make a mistake you know it'll help you out and give you that that heads up
42:38
alert um the other one is you can use a a safe you can use a safe multi Sig
42:43
where you can have let's say one hot wallet is Aigner and then two other addresses that are Harbor wallets ass
42:49
signers you can still use you know a combo of hot wallets and cold wallets um
42:55
and you can rotate keys out if if one of your wallets gets compromised if there's something so that way it's much much
43:01
harder to fall prey to you know somebody somebody trying to get approvals for
43:06
something um and I think there's a lot of things you can do in defi whether it's using a hardware wallet or just um
43:13
practicing good wallet hygiene where let's say you have three wallets one of them is for nfts one of them is just
43:20
like a vault wallet where all you're doing is storing the majority of your funds and then another wallet is your
43:25
defi wallet where you know you're deploying funds in def5 protocols but you're kind of segregating how you're
43:31
managing your funds that way if one of them is compromised you're not going to lose everything so there's a lot of
43:37
things you can do to stay safe um I think there's a lot of great resources out there if anybody on this call is not
43:43
familiar with um CIA officer on Twitter uh it's a funny handle but I think his
43:49
handle on Twitter is Officer CIA um he has been my go-to for learning about
43:55
opsec and crypto um he a lot of great resources about the differences in hardware and software wallets he has
44:02
recommendations on good Hardware wallets which you'll find the liest one in there uh he talks about common scams you know
44:08
ways to stay safe and kind of uh common scams that people are running in crypto
44:14
so there's a lot of great educational resources out there as well um and I will say you know if you ever have any
44:19
questions feel free to D me DM me on on Twitter or reach out to me on Discord um
44:24
and I think the same goes for Justin and the folks in the grid plus Discord I will say though that if you ask a random
44:31
person on Discord to help you set up a wallet um you might run into some problems there so just be careful who
44:36
you're trusting um but yeah there are a lot of great people working in
44:42
crypto and um yeah a lot of great people
44:47
working in crypto and a lot of people willing to help um if you can reach out to the right folks yeah that's that's a good one
44:53
mentioning Discord I mean so even ours I think um I'm on the discords and
44:59
channels from most other Hardware wallets and other tools out there and I think uh one of the most active channels
45:05
in some of those servers is the report scammers one you know we have on our own server everybody who's part of the team
45:11
has a certain role our names appear in Blue uh but always in the middle of the night someone will come with a you know
45:17
question about how to get set up and then there will be someone like you know saying click this link to to set up a
45:23
ticket it'll be some random account that joined the server five minutes before um so that is one of the the biggest things
45:29
too um we talked about those are great tips account segregation is really important you know have your deep Cold
45:34
Storage separate from where you're minting your nfts and what you're using with dii protocols um but the oldest
45:41
thing in the book uh with with any sort of scam uh is what we call social
45:46
engineering which is just basically the way that um Bad actors manipulate you um
45:52
and that predates the internet and computers but the way in which that happens with crypto today yeah it's the
45:58
misleading links that you see on Twitter people pretending to be support um so
46:04
you need to verify these things um you know one area where you can run into trouble is even with great dii protocols
46:10
try Googling one instead of entering the address that you know to be correct you're probably going to pull up like
46:15
five search results for malicious copies of that that are trying to get you to sign something you don't intend to um
46:22
same with the App Store you know there's always malicious versions of metamask mobile being posted in there um in both
46:30
you know the Google Play and the Apple App Store this has happened quite a bit and takes like a day or two to get those
46:36
down um so yeah bookmark the sites that you know are correct don't be clicking
46:42
stuff from Twitter and you know be careful of that those social engineering attack vectors you people out to mislead
46:49
you into a a place where you don't want to be I will say the other thing is if
46:56
you're looking for a dii protocol and you're not sure of the website instead of trying to find them on Twitter
47:02
instead of trying to look them up on Google just go to defi llama um defi
47:07
llama is probably one of the most valuable open- Source free uh resources
47:14
in crypto so if you're not familiar with defi llama you definitely should be they track tvl for a bunch of protocols
47:21
they're always going to have the link to the website and the link to their official Twitter for any given protocol
47:27
so you know this is like the go-to place when I'm looking even if I'm familiar
47:33
with the website unless it's something I'm doing every day I always go to defi llama so I make sure that I get the
47:39
right link for that website so definitely use some stuff like that that people are building that's a great tip
47:46
um you know I I try basically every new chain out there once they get some viable tooling you know buy 20 30 bucks
47:52
worth of a coin and just experiment and when I want to see you know what I should try out on that chain I go to
47:58
defi llama and I follow the links from there to check out dex's and whatever other tools are available um so that is
48:04
a great directory it's defil llama.com um absolutely worth working from one
48:11
other thing too I just wanted to reiterate um so earlier in the call there is a pop po mint going on now
48:16
we're coming up on the close of the window uh we're going to give away a Lattis one bundle worth 440 bucks so if
48:24
you have the POA app there's a secret word which is um let me just double check is it safe card or safe cards
48:31
plural go it is it is it was safe card but that actually oh open for 15 minutes
48:37
oh I'm so sorry guys okay I was just trying to get people in under the wire to give them a shot but uh sorry about
48:43
that yeah that's all right um all right well on that too yeah
48:49
that's a great resource be really careful how you're clicking through um what else what else is uh are you
48:54
curious about Brave New defi yeah you know I'd love to hear about
49:00
some of the stuff you're working on on lius I was poking around in the Discord um and I saw a mention of the lattice 2
49:08
and um some other things you're working on so if there's any Alpha that you'd like to share with us on the call that would be that'd be great yeah I love to
49:15
talk about that so yeah there's a lot of work going on under the hood the lattice one itself is a really flexible device
49:22
so there's so much more that we can do with it and some things are pretty wonky you know what we're doing the codebase
49:28
to make it faster more performant and have a prettier user interface um big
49:33
initiatives for this year we are going broadly multi-chain um I mentioned that we did the first contract parser for
49:40
salana um we're still waiting for integration partners and we're subject to their their schedules so it's coming
49:47
you know in the coming quarter but we don't know exact dates yet um but we'll have the first Hardware wallet that can
49:52
actually display live pars Salon as signing transactions on the Fly same
49:58
we're doing that with Cosmos we are going to break around with Kepler in about two weeks really excited about that one um so there's a lot of
50:05
improvements and additional features coming to the lattice one itself uh but yeah maybe the the real Alpha is that
50:12
it's a ways off when you make a hardware product it's about an 18 to 24mth cycle but we've kicked off that cycle for our
50:18
next device when we've had the lce out now for a couple of years we talk to our users every day um we know what they
50:25
want to see done differently um features they'd like to add so we are basically
50:30
in the stage now of research and development and planning out our next device a mobile one which is going to be
50:37
we hope like the endgame solution that anyone will be looking at if they sign with anyone should be recommending and
50:43
using if they sign on chain with any regularity so how does it relate to our current stack well it's going to retain
50:49
a lot of the same properties um it's going to have readable transactions in the same way um the for form factor will
50:56
B basically look like um a small phone like a mini tablet with a card reader on the top and the card reader the safe
51:02
cards is another critical thing that we're retaining we're the only company out there that has an encrypted backup
51:08
solution for both your seed phrase and your private keys this is a huge pain Point people do crazy things to try and
51:15
safely back up their private keys but we're working crypto why is no one else using cryptography it's it's vexing um
51:21
so this is an easy way to make copies of keys or store accounts that'll carry through um
51:27
the pixel density and the screen and everything will be a little bit nicer a little more performant we're adding another chip into the secure Enclave
51:33
that will let us meet users expectation for a tablet device you know people are used to using phones so they expect it
51:39
to be fast and performant uh look a certain way I have haptic feedback so
51:45
yeah that's going to be more or less it we're going to be switching to USBC and Battery um and we're just really excited
51:51
about it it's going to be a lot more powerful and come in at a lower price point than what we're offering now uh
51:57
we've learned a lot of lessons over the course of the past few years um and we're really excited uh I think you know
52:04
we are something of a dark horse for leading in this market segment uh but we've got a a deep base of users who are
52:11
you protocol devs and L2 Founders and people who are signing all the time and now I think with all the feedback and
52:18
all the lessons we've learned uh next year when we deliver this device we're targeting Q3 of 2025 to be ready for
52:24
holiday season um I think this is going to take a lot of people by surprise and you guys are hearing about it early I
52:30
think this is going to be a real Mass Market moment for us um the last one I love it the form factor is you know it's
52:36
a desktop device I think there's an upper bound on how much Market penetration you get with that there's a lot of people who are on the go all the
52:42
time a lot of crypto Nomads so um the next device won't be called the lattice 2 we have not come up with a thoroughly
52:48
badass new name yet open to suggestions um everything we bring up internally everyone else in the team shoots down um
52:56
even including internal code names uh but yeah man we're really excited for me
53:02
it's about I sign every day I use these tools and I have the majority of my
53:07
family's wealth secured with our products um both a lattice one and safe cards for my deep Cold Storage in case
53:13
you want to come hit me in the knees with a wrench um I use multi-sig and not all the pieces are here it's a great way
53:20
to have security um for these things as uh not having physical access uh that
53:25
you can be uh you know forced to unlock something under duress so I have my
53:30
personal deep Cold Storage set across multiple safe cards using a nois safe no just called safe um with different
53:37
physical locations um but yeah I mean I trust and rely on our own Hardware
53:44
um maybe I'm I'm obviously very biased uh but I I wouldn't trust my family's
53:50
wealth with anything else out there for self- custody and uh we're really excited now as someone who relies so
53:56
much on our own tools both for signing every day interacting with blockchains
54:01
securing meaningful a meaningful part of my Networth um to be able to design the perfect tool for us for me um is like a
54:09
dream come true um if you guys are hearing this come and talk to us on uh on our Discord too hit me up in uh in
54:16
DMS on Twitter as well we really want to know you know we're going to start us our interviews soon and that's going to mean everything from the most
54:23
sophisticated protocol devs to people who are just dipping their toes into crypto for the first time and we want to
54:28
know what the endgame wallet looks like for you uh what is the perfect device what are your pain points now and how
54:35
can we make this better for you um so a lot of it will be you know we've got you know all the components and the
54:40
additional original ideas the core of this all set already still some flexibility at this stage um but we
54:46
don't want it to be an engineering Le project only we wanted to we want users to tell us what they want and what they
54:53
need and we want the engineering to meet those needs because I don't think anything out there uh is remotely good
54:59
enough yet but I think we're the people who are going to be delivering that in the near future and uh just like I said
55:05
dream come true to be able to design something like this with our team from the ground up uh incorporating all that
55:10
we've learned over the years and all we've heard from all of you who are you lat us users and been really supportive
55:15
and spread the word for us so yeah come come at us with all your ideas on that
55:22
and and additionally too so you know our focus is primarily security in our own mission statement uh the first thing
55:28
that we say is that we prioritize securing user assets above all else um
55:35
if it came down to backdooring a device under duress from a government we'll
55:40
shut down the company um there was no circumstance in which we could ever break that Bond of trust so that's
55:47
number one so we always think about security but uh you know metaphors are always imperfect I talk about us uh
55:53
internally a little bit like a car manufacturer all the Engineers we're focused on the best engine uh the most
55:58
power the most efficiency so for us that's security um but when it comes to cars people really love the radios and
56:04
cup holders so also think about the cup holders you know what are the things you want to do that are fun on a device that
56:10
will make you use it more you know display nfts that you have uh you know
56:15
provably that you provably own on the lock screen is it having price tickers um on the lock screen as well you know
56:22
what are the things is it endend encrypted Ultra secure messaging across ethereum addresses or other crypto
56:28
addresses these are things that aren't heavy lifts for us and we're really curious about what would be fun on a
56:33
device like this to get you to use it more often so yeah I mean I'm open to questions on this but uh it's still
56:41
we're getting close to finalizing the hardware spec we're going to be doing the user research um reaching out to
56:46
people conducting video interviews and also surveys and uh I couldn't I could
56:52
not be more excited and it's still going to be cross- compatible with the lattice I use the lattice one every day I have
56:57
every account I've ever spun up on safe cards and those same safe cards will be cross-compatible with your mobile device
57:02
so uh like Brave New defi was saying you don't want you want account segregation you know you don't cash out your bank
57:08
account to go grocery shopping so when you go to a conference you don't take your deep Cold Storage with you you take
57:13
what you want to spend on the go in a separate safe card and plug that into the device so we think this is flexible
57:19
and it's going to better match how people you know use traditional Financial assets but in the crypto
57:25
space yeah I am definitely looking forward to
57:30
both of those developments Justin um yeah I just wanted to say again thanks for joining us today I think we're about
57:36
at time so I'll have Sam wrap things up but thank you so much for the conversation and thanks to everybody for

thank you so much Justin this was an amazing conversation um for everyone who
58:04
joined us on the call and M the PO app will be running drawing in one hour and we'll let the winner know Ray will
58:11

58:19
enjoyed the interview today don't forget to join us on Thursday on April 4th for
58:25
our next covering thei interview well where we'll talk about um wallfacer labs
58:32

58:39
that brave uses in his state of defi reports and uh you see those reports
58:45
featured on the Nexus mutual account every so often we hope to see you there
58:50
have a great day everyone and thanks again bye right bye everybody
