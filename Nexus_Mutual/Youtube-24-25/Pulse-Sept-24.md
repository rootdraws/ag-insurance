hey everyone welcome to this week's Nexus Mutual Community call it's great
0:11
to have you here as we dive into the latest updates from the Nexus Mutual echos system here is what we've got on
Agenda
0:18
today's agenda R new defi who is joining us from the Nexus Mutual main account will give
0:26
a recap on the current state of dii covering yields and risk we'll go over
0:32
governance updates including discussions around offboarding die and adding the
0:38
delegated claims functionality as always we'll hear the latest from the foundation team from
0:46
Hugh and we'll finish up with highlights on community contribution opportunities
0:53
followed by an open forum for questions comments and details on how to claim
0:58
your poab all right let's kick things off with defi Brave what's the latest in the
1:08
space good morning everybody I will provide an overview of the market and
State of DeFi
1:14
the yield environment in defi before we get into some other updates there so in
1:19
the last two weeks since we were on a call together the price of eth saw a low at about um 2200 and climbed as high as
1:28
uh just about 2700 yesterday today with today's price settling at
1:33
$2,638 ether is up 12.7 Point uh 12.73% since we last talked and this momentum
1:41
likely resulted from the US federal reserves move to cut interest rates by 50 basis points with the signal that
1:47
further rate Cuts could come in the future in my state of defi yields newsletter from last week I noted that
1:53
shortterm US Treasury rates were higher than the onchain base rate but since the news of that rate cut short-term US
1:59
Treasury have fallen below the onchain base rate which makes onchain yield markets more competitive against traditional markets e funding rates have
2:07
come up slightly with rates ranging from 5 to 11% across major exchanges
2:12
according to coin allies the long vers short ratio on a one day time frame is 68% long 32% short so we're starting to
2:20
see more bullish momentum in the market but in my opinion it's still too soon to tell which direction we're heading in so
2:26
while the market is uncertain great yield opportunities are still present out there between moral vaults and
2:32
notional V3 right now you can find double digit lending yields ranging from 10%
2:38
25% other markets like a compound moonwell and many more F vaults offer
2:44
yields at uh about or above the current US Treasury rates level since maker Dow
2:52
has rebranded the sky money they've launched usds and the sky savings rate which is a
2:58
little bit higher than the D Sr rate so the sky savings rate offers depositors
3:04
6.25% well which is well above the US Treasury rate usds holders can also
3:10
stake their usds in the sky protocol to earn Sky token rewards but that's separate from the sky savings rate as I
3:18
highlighted in last week's issue of the state of defi yields contango markets offer yields ranging from 5% to 30% with
3:24
the median yield in the 20% range there's quite a few opportunities for eth lsts and lrts on Kango as well so
3:33
that's been um One Market that I've been noting in my newsletter yields on extra Finance have also been high for leverage
3:39
Farmers with the DOA usdc Farm earning 18.65% on average over the last 30 days
3:46
so there's still quite a few good yield opportunities out there I'll be covering the latest ones in this week's issue of
3:52
the state of defi yields which comes out tomorrow I also wrote a short summary on hacks and onchain risks in the latest
3:59
issue which covered the $27 million peny hack and the $6 million Delta Prime hack
4:07
so while yields are available on chain and you can get some solid yields in defi protocols earning yield in defi
4:14
does come with risks at Nexus Mutual we're working to make it easier to protect yourself against these risks we
4:19
have a variety of different cover products but we've been working on one in particular with open cover to launch
4:24
a new product to help people have all-in-one coverage that provides protection for leading protocols in one
4:30
given network network ecosystem so the first one that we're launching which I talked about last week is the base def5
4:37
pass which includes protection across aerodrone B compound V3
4:43
extrafield Moro overnight and Unis swap B3 for a fixed annual fee of
4:49
3.99% so if you'd like to join the beta for the D5 base pass or the base defi
4:55
pass head to the open cover X account or join the open cover Discord and fill out the request form so you can purchase
5:02
your base defi pass if you want to learn more about the Bas def5 pass head to the Nexus Mutual docs and check out the D5
5:09
pass cover entry under the cover product section so with that I will talk about
New Listings
5:15
some new listings in the Nexus Mutual UI and go over some updates from the investment community's August newsletter
5:21
so in the last two weeks we've added several new listings we've added the oiler Finance V2 protocol cover listing
5:27
we've added a listing for Ana AA Finance Dolomite AO
5:33
staking uh gamma Swap all of those are protocol cover listings we've also added
5:38
the ssds sky savings rate contract protocol cover and then we've added two
5:44
new bundle protocol cover products which are both for ethery liquid vaults so the ethery liquid Elixir stable vaults and
5:50
the ethery liquid usual stable Vault we've also updated a few of our listings
5:57
to reflect protocol rebrands so the maker Dow CDP protocol cover was updated
6:02
to Sky money protocol cover and the moro listing has been updated to Moro plus metamorpho vaults bot protocol cover all
6:10
of the markets that are covered are and all of the covered markets and vaults are outlined in the annex document that
6:16
you can find that listing as well um with that Rebrand it's a lot easier before we had the listing split out by
6:23
the um risk generators for the markets but this way if you're in waro and you
6:28
want to get covered you just check those markets if your markets are on there then you can buy that coverage and protect yourself against risk in the
6:35
moro and Moro Vault smart contracts and as always if you have a listing that
6:40
you'd like us to check out or review for a potential new listing you can send me a DM on X reach out to me in the Nexus
6:47
mut Discord server or send me a message through the contact form on the Nexus Mutual
6:53
website on to the updates from the investment committee uh the IC shared the August investment update on the
Investment Committee Newsletter
6:59
Forum earlier this month and I wanted to summarize this report for folks on the call today over the last month the
7:05
capital pool was reduced by 2.3% in E terms the largest impact was from
7:11
withdrawals via the ram which is the often cause of a reduction over time uh
7:16
there were 2.8k total redemptions which reflected the exit of a large wxm
7:22
position in the month of August there's been a large positive FX impact as a
7:27
result of stable coin Holdings due to the drop in the eth price over the month of August as well as an above average
7:33
result from cover fees on the a loan side on the 6th of August The Advisory Board repaid 272k usdc from the a loan
7:42
which brings the outstanding debt balance down to 5.71 million usdc before
7:49
that it was at 5.98 million um on the S divestment side uh we passed the
7:55
proposal to have a divestment framework to make sure that we have enough liquidity and the capital pool for Ram
8:00
redemptions and for any claims that need to be paid so on the 21st of August The Advisory Board completed a sale of
8:07
4,392 St e for eth as per that divestment framework that members approved which brings the total eth in
8:14
the capital pool back up to 12,500 so for the Investments themselves
8:21
the last month the mutual earned 9.2 eth on its Investments overall the capital
8:26
pool earned 1.6% API based on that average Capital pool value over the course of the month it's a little bit
8:33
lower than it usually is uh last month as as I shared in that update rocket pool had a higher API just because uh
8:42
they had some wonky stuff with the rebase so they' recalibrated that so that one was slightly negative um so
8:48
that's brought the average apy down should be back to normal next month um other updates from the investment
8:54
committee uh they've completed documentation for the ongoing divestment and a loan repayment trans transactions
9:00
the invest uh investment Community is also working with enzyme and chanan to incorporate the unclaimed kill rewards
9:06
into the Nexus Mutual enzyme bolt Oracle the recent ethery and stake wise in
9:12
chorus one Investments have gone live and are being captured by that Oracle as well and on the Dow treasury investment
9:18
side since carpy's proposal was approved they are being onboarded into the Dow as
9:24
a service provider right now they're currently going through the strategies and just finalizing all of that setting up The Vault they're going to be
9:30
managing funds through and getting all of that taken care of so once they are actually live up and running we will
9:37
share an update on the Forum and Kaki will start posting their monthly updates I also want to talk about the V1
V1 Deprecation Update
9:45
deprecation and that n nxm distribution uh that we had talked about previously so on the last call I had shared an
9:51
update about the Foundation Engineering team uh the Foundation Engineering team's project to deprecate the Nexus
9:58
Mutual V1 smart contracts V2 was launched uh almost two years ago
10:04
so they've been working to deprecate those contracts and then claim any nxm
10:09
and send that back to anybody who still had nxm in the V1 smart contracts so
10:15
when we talked last time it was still ongoing it's been completed so if you had any nxm in the V1 smart contracts
10:22
that's been claimed and sent back to you by the Foundation Engineering team they covered all the gas costs so if you see
10:27
it examing your wallet and and you weren't expecting it it's because you had nxm in the Nexus Mutual V1 contracts
10:35
so if you had nxm in the V1 contracts from cover deposits claim assessment Stakes staken Rewards or nxm Stakes that
10:42
were in the pooled staking contract which is where you would have stake them for risk assessment V1 that nxm is now
10:48
in your wallet and as a reminder you can always verify the legitimacy of the token by checking it against the
10:53
official token contract address and you can find that at sdk. Nexus mutual. Io
11:00
if you have any questions about this feel free to reach out to us through the contact form on the website or open a ticket in the NEX Mutual Discord
11:07
server so on the governance updates side we've got three proposals that are on the Forum I'd like to go through and
Governance Updates
11:14
just summarize these three proposals um they're all rfc's so they're open for review and comment here over the next
11:20
couple of weeks uh the first one we can get started with is the RFC to approve
Delegated Claims
11:25
the addition of delegated claims for select product types so the foundation and DOW teams have been prioritizing
11:31
growth and cover sales and onboarding new syndicates um when I say syndicates I mean staking pool managers that have
11:37
an existing distribution pipeline so we're currently working to on board a new Syndicate that can meaningfully
11:43
contribute to the growth of cover sales and this Syndicate will require additional functionality to offer new
11:49
product types through their staking pool um and this functionality needed specifically the ability to delegate
11:56
claim assessment to a specific ethereum address um which they would have as a designated assessor if claims come
12:02
through so this functionality would enable certain product types to have a designated thirdparty claim assessor as
12:08
defined in the cover wording for that product type if someone were to buy cover for a product type with delegated
12:14
claims enabled then claims for that product type could only be assessed by that designated claim assessor um so I
12:21
have proposed on the Forum that members approve the addition of delegated claims functionality for select product types
12:27
this would be for bespoke deals um with some of these new syndicates it's not going to be for all product types most
12:34
of our product types like protocol cover and botom protocol cover will stay the same with the same claims functionality
12:40
um this will just be for certain deals and will definitely be denoted in the UI if this is approved so if this were
12:47
approved then the mutual could work on uh could work with select staking pool managers to create new cover products
12:53
that would have that requirement to have a designated claim assessor rather than opening that claim vot to all members as
13:00
we currently do for most of our product types um this would allow specialized assessors to review a claim and this
13:06
would allow us to open up new lines of business and onboard other syndicates we've had a few other syndicates that
13:12
have indicated that this is functionality they would really like and it's kind of a requirement for them to become onboarded into the mutual so I
13:18
hope that you'll check out this RFC on the Forum this is going to be open for review um until the 3rd of October and
13:25
if there's no substantial comments um this has already been on the Forum since the 19th of September if there's no
13:31
substantial comments and feedback during that review period Then This RFC is going to transition to an nmp i and that
13:37
nmip will be open for review for at least seven days before moving to an onchain vote which is currently
13:43
scheduled for the 17th of October which is a Thursday before I move on are there any questions about this RFC before I
13:51
move over to a review of the next
13:57
proposal okay yeah not let's talk about offboarding die from the capital pool so
Offboarding DAI
14:02
we have an RFC to offboard die as a capital pool asset uh if you're not aware on the 18th of September maker Dow
14:09
rebranded to Sky money and they launched their new stable coin usds this Rebrand
14:14
is part of Sky money's ingame plan to scale their stable coin adoption across the sky protocol while existing die
14:22
holders can convert die to usds that's completely optional and user can still hold die or convert back uh at this time
14:30
I don't know what that's going to be like in the future I believe that maker is going to move to a form of die that's
14:36
called Pure diey um but given Sky money is moving toward more real world asset
14:41
backing usds has a blacklist function and we the product and RIS team anticipate that die denominated cover
14:47
demand will further shrink I propose that next Mutual members vote to offboard die as a capital pull asset and
14:53
Grant The Advisory Board the power to complete the four stages of offboarding which are disabling die denominated
14:59
cover buys at the user interface level um waiting for the last die cover to expire in the grace period for that
15:05
cover to end which typically for most products is 35 days and then swapping all die in the capital pool for usdc and
15:12
the fourth stage would be offboarding die as an asset in the capital pool so since usdc was onboarded at the capital
15:19
pool and enabled as a cover denomination type the usdc has grown to represent 43%
15:25
of total active cover while die cover has dropped to just 20% of total active cover the majority of that die exposure
15:33
is just one large cover and that expires at the end of this month so our die exposure is going to drop down um
15:39
significantly I think down to something like uh maybe two to three per. so one of the core reasons the whole die in the
15:45
capital pool in the first place was to offer next Mutual members a censorship resistant decentralized stable coin as a
15:50
claim payment option and as centralized collateral for D has grown and
15:56
usds um usds is going to increase that exposure
16:02
to real world assets over time the product and risk team believes that the recent onboarding of usdc to the capital
16:08
pool is sufficient for our membership base as a cover denomination claim payment option for stable coin
16:14
denominated to cover in the future we may look to onboard usds once it has
16:19
achieved more growth and if demand for usds denominated to cover is evident uh this RFC is going to be open for review
16:25
from the 23rd of September until the 7th of October if there are no substantial comments and feedback during the review
16:31
period Then This Will transition to an nmip and then this one would be up for review for at least seven days and it's
16:38
currently scheduled to go to an onchain vote on the 17th of October which again is a Thursday any questions about this
16:45
proposal before I move on to the next
16:51
one okay uh we have another RFC on the Forum which is onboarding CB BTC as a
Onboarding cbBTC
16:57
capital pool asset so on the 12th of September coinbase launched coinbase wrapped BTC or CV BTC a BTC derivative
17:06
that is back one to one with Bitcoin held in custy by coinbase onboarding CB
17:11
BTC as a capital pool asset would present the mutual with the competitive Advantage as the foundation and DOW
17:17
teams look to expand into new lines of business and appeal to a broader audience of Crypton native users so on
17:23
behalf of the product and RIS team I've also proposed that Nexus Mutual members vote to onboard CBB C is a capital pool
17:30
asset and Grant The Advisory Board the power to complete the three stages of onboarding the first of which would be
17:35
onboarding CB BTC is an asset in the capital pool um swapping eth for cbtc
17:42
with the initial amount to hold in the capital pool would be $1 million worth of CB BTC and then enabling CBBC
17:49
denominated cover buys at the user interface level so why is CBBC I've
17:54
outlined uh in great detail on the Forum uh the business cases and the risks of
17:59
onboarding but The quick summary for the business cases is that CB BTC has grown really quickly it launched just two
18:05
weeks ago and it's already reached a market cap of 185. eight million as of this morning with
18:12
2944 BTC backing CB BTC this puts CV BTC
18:17
in the top 20 of bridged protocol tbll rankings on Def laa in just two weeks
18:24
time uh CBBC is poised for growth of the institutional layer and across
18:29
is Major lending Pro protocols have already worked to onboard this asset into their markets if they're not
18:35
currently working on it right now uh given coinbase is the primary custodian for both the BTC and E ETFs there's a
18:42
high likelihood that CB btc's market share will grow substantially by the end of
18:47
2024 onboarding this as a capital pool asset would also provote the mutual with a competitive Advantage as we look to
18:54
expand the new lines of businesses um these CB BTC denominated covers would
18:59
also be a first for any onchain or offchain Market which can really help the mutual appeal to Crypton native and
19:06
institutional users primarily holding BTC uh this would also help us tap into
19:13
some Capital starve markets such as underwriting uh cover for BTC mining operations um which could really help
19:20
further scale cover sales the mutual would also be the only provider in the market offering BTC denominated cover to
19:26
these businesses so this could result in some real tangible growth and then with the introduction of reaking across the
19:33
ethereum and Bitcoin networks there are now yield opportunities available to BTC holders outside of standard defi yields
19:40
so the growth in yield opportunities for BTC derivatives opens up a potential new line of business for the mutual based on
19:46
Smart contract and slashing risk so I have a lot more information in this proposal um if you want to check that
19:52
out the business case the risk associated with onboarding cbtc to the capital pool see that RFC on the Forum
19:59
that RFC is going to be open for review from today the 24th of of September until the 8th of October if there are no
20:06
substantial comments and feedback during that period Then This RFC is going to transition to an npip that's going to be
20:11
open for at least seven days of review before moving to an onchain boat which is also scheduled for the 17th of October which is the Thursday so we look
20:19
forward to everyone checking out those proposals on the Forum reviewing and leaving any comments or feedback um just
20:27
one last thing here is are there any questions on this RFC before I hand things over to Hugh on the foundation
20:39
side okay if not I'm sure everyone's tired of hearing me talk and so I will let you hear H talk as I pass things
20:46
over to him for his foundation updates for the week you cool thanks Brave um yeah I guess a
Updates From The Foundation
20:54
couple of things but I might just start with my um just personal perspective on some of the um the rfc's um on the I'll
21:01
start with the BTC one just because um we just talked about that most recently but um I think there's a pretty large
21:07
Strategic Benefit here of becoming um providing coverage in in BTC Dom domination so I'm really kind of excited
21:13
to do it there's a whole lot of um businesses that would like crypto um or BTC denominated coverage like c a lot of
21:21
custodial risk is um is BTC denominated um Bitcoin miners are a big umig
21:28
area where they have like genuine insurance needs such as you know um property damage and all that type of
21:33
stuff so there's there's definitely um a large potential um offering that we can
21:39
provide in BTC denomination that that there isn't any other place um in the
21:45
either the traditional markets or um decentralized markets that offer um BTC denomination so I think that's a really
21:51
um powerful one we have been keeping an eye on like we we we've been wanting to do this for a while but haven't been
21:57
super happy with I guess the risk profile of R BTC and seeing where it's going and understanding it um so I guess
22:04
that's my perspective I've been a bit cautious um I would I wouldn't say CB the coinbase BDC ticks all the boxes yet
22:11
at the moment but especially like on the proof of Reserve side but um but I think the direction of travel is good so um
22:17
hopefully we can get discussion on the Forum on that and and hopefully things improve over over time as well um so you
22:24
know that's on the on the BTC side that's my perspective the the die one um
22:30
you can you can see my brief comments on the Forum to me this is a no-brainer we just need to um the it's been deprecated
22:37
asset and it costs extra gas when we have assets that we we don't um actively use in the capital pool so it it
22:43
increases the cost of gas forever covered by so um best to keep it to a minimum so it makes sense to off die um
22:50
most covers uh inst Stables are boarding usdc at the moment um and um I guess we
22:56
can always add um assets in the future if if want to so if usds or another
23:01
stable coin is becomes more used then we can we can do that um on the delegated claims this one this one I'm really kind
23:08
of excited about um it it's it's an interesting one because it
23:21
um for the members of the mutual to consider from a do we want to enable this type of stuff I think there are a
23:27
lot of Strategic Benefit in doing it we've seen a lot of demand for this type of thing and um I mean two of the main
23:33
questions that we get um when um people want to buy cover are how do I know
23:39
you're going to have enough money to pay out and then we can point them to the the um the June dashboards are transparency that we've got and that
23:45
that helps a long way and the second question is how do I know you're actually going to pay the claims and um
23:51
and I believe a decentralized claims assessment process is can be really powerful um and but um also some people
23:59
just want to be able to go then who is going to do this and um and I want to
24:07
know that they have the right skills Etc so this would allow us to um calibrate um the products um for the particular um
24:15
audience and and we've seen quite a lot of demand for this one they said s is a very high priority um a high priority
24:22
thing for the mutual top um to be able to work with the mutual so from our product development side of things I see
24:28
this quite um quite important um so that's my quick background or my quick
24:33
perspective on the rsc's that are out at the moment in terms of um Foundation
24:39
update um we we're we're doing we're supporting a lot of um work on
24:44
syndicates uh at the moment which I think is really exciting and is really where we want to get to from a platform
24:49
point of view um we're supporting open cover in particular quite a lot with the launch of the defi pass um it's really
24:56
excited to see that kind of go live live private beter at the moment but um looking for that to be further rolled
25:02
out I really I think it's a really cool product um so excited to see how that goes um we're also the other thing um
25:09
it's been good to see has been the um it's been live for a little bit but the open cover have promoted it recently and
25:14
that's the transaction cover um and so it covers people against um like there's
25:20
a scanning process about is this transaction going to do what you say what it says it's going to do and if it does it's all fine and if it doesn't um
25:27
and the um and if it doesn't and the um
25:32
the transaction fails then that's when the um the coverage can kick in so I think that's that's really powerful one
25:37
and I'd love to kind of see it see this coverage embedded everywhere because it kind of also can protect against front
25:43
end attacks which is kind of really quite hard to to do usually so um from a product point of view that's also really
25:48
cool um and really excited to see how we can expand the use of that product and maybe get it embedded in more places so
25:55
um so that's pretty cool um so so that's supporting open cover we're
26:01
also supporting um we're also supporting Sherlock with cover renewals and they're
26:06
looking to kind of expand products and things like that so we're having a lot of discussions with them um we've been
26:13
working I've mentioned this a few times we still kind of can't announce announce stuff yet but um we're working behind
26:18
the scenes with a broking operation um at the at the moment um and they're kind
26:24
of just getting set up and stuff so um we're we're discussing a few potential deals with them as well which is which is really quite cool and they're looking
26:30
to become um a Syndicate as well which is great they're staking pool um and
26:35
we're also working with um with in share which are the the people that are um behind trm the retail Mutual deal which
26:43
is um one of our cool real world asset um real world deals um which covers like
26:48
just genuine like non non- crypto risks um and so um it's it's good and they're
26:53
looking to potentially transform into a Syndicate as well so that would be um that would be really cool as well but
26:59
you know definitely early stages takes a while happen but um I think there's a lot of work from the foundation on the
27:05
BD it's a aspects bespoke deals supporting cicat then on the engineering
27:11
side we're going through the um the a pretty solid backlog of um of product
27:17
enhancements to it to roll out um whether that's um making more flexibility on the on the swaps that
27:23
we're working on um the cover reddits um delegated um claims hopefully and we're
27:31
