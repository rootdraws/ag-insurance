0:13
familiar defi Edge is built on top of
0:15
Unis swap V3 and the protocol connects
0:18
liquidity providers with strategy
0:20
managers um so people who want to
0:23
provide liquidity can have a more
0:25
streamlined process and a a better way

to LP and Unis SWAT V3 pools strategy
0:32
managers can actively manage assets
0:35
provided by users and help them take
0:37
advantage of increased yields in un swap
0:40
V3 without spending a lot of time and
0:42
effort continuously updating uh
