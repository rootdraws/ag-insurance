hello everyone and welcome to this
0:08
week's Nexus Mutual Community
0:10
call we're happy to have you listen to
0:13
us today as we continue to discuss the
0:15
latest developments in the Nexus Mutual
0:18
ecosystem our agenda for today includes
Agenda
0:21
a conversation on the state of defi in
0:24
yields and risk led by Brave New
0:27
defi an overview of the new listings in
0:30
Nexus Mutual UI as well as updates from
0:33
Nexus Mutual governance and the
0:38
foundation we'll also have a special
0:41
segment on product development and
0:43
listing requests management today and as
0:46
always we'll open the floor for any
0:49
questions or comments in our open Forum
0:51
segment where I'll also share details on
0:54
how to claim your PO app for attending
0:57
today
1:00
let's kick things off with the state of
1:02
defi Brave how is defi doing these
State of DeFi
1:09
days hey everybody uh good morning I
1:12
will provide an overview of the current
1:14
market the yield environment in defi
1:16
before we get into some other updates
1:18
today in the last several weeks since I
1:21
gave an update on the state of defi
1:23
we've seen each drop below
1:25
3,000 we' actually seen it drop near the
1:27
$2,000 Mark but it's rebounded up to uh
1:31
$2,600 macro headwinds and fears about a
1:34
potential recession of spread from triy
1:36
markets in the crypto markets but with
1:38
potential rate uh with potential rate
1:40
Cuts coming from the US Federal Reserve
1:43
we may see a potential rebound but there
1:46
is a lot writing on the outcome of the
1:47
US election in November as well when I
1:50
look at funding rates for eth and uh BTC
1:53
I'm still seeing low to mid digigit
1:55
positive rates with some markets paying
1:58
long to the moment I always use this as
2:00
a metric when assessing bullish
2:01
sentiment in the market so we're back in
2:04
a crab market for the time being until
2:06
some other Catalyst comes along to move
2:08
the markets in One Direction or the
2:09
other I'm currently working on a new
2:12
issue of state of defi uh The Weekly
2:15
Newsletter it's been on Hiatus for the
2:17
summer but I'm working on bringing it
2:19
back uh as part of the writing process
2:22
I've analyzed lending rates across
2:24
stable coins and a compound V3 fluid
2:27
moonwell Moro blue and Spark Finance
2:30
overall the average apy across the
2:32
stable coin markets is
2:35
4.09% which is roughly 2% lower than the
2:37
current D savings rate appetite for
2:40
leverage across defi isn't high at the
2:42
moment I'm assuming this is due to the
2:44
big blowout several weeks ago that
2:46
caused a significant amount of
2:47
liquidations and it's likely caused
2:49
traders to be more cautious but still
2:52
there are protocols where you can earn
2:53
Tractive yields on your stable coins eth
2:56
and eth derivatives we've just listed
2:58
some contango bundles which which I'll
3:00
talk more about shortly contango which
3:02
creates simplified leverage yield
3:04
strategies has provided attractive
3:06
yields on l2s uh the best yields are in
3:09
the range on contango between 22 and
3:12
34% um that also involves using leverage
3:14
so definitely be careful if you're
3:15
checking that out I've also seen some
3:18
great yields on decentralized exchanges
3:19
for correlated Pairs ramsy vome and Unis
3:23
swap B3 offer some of the highest deals
3:25
for correlated pairs or when I say that
3:27
I mean like eth and eth derivatives or
3:29
St coin stable coin pairs where
3:31
permanent loss really isn't much of an
3:32
issue I'll have more uh detail in my
3:35
state of D5 newsletter which should go
3:37
out later today but there are definitely
3:39
still places to earn some pretty
3:41
attractive yields in defi um on chain
3:44
but that being said while yields remain
3:46
high we're still seeing hacks across T5
3:48
protocols and T infrastructure ear
3:51
earlier this month poly network was
3:53
hacked for $5 million due to a Rey
3:55
attack the Ronin Bridge was exploited
3:57
for 12 million and Delta Prime was
3:59
exploited for $1 million due to a
4:02
missing check in some of their protocol
4:04
logic uh if you're looking for a great
4:06
read on the impact of hacks uh Mitchell
4:08
Amador just released an article on X
4:11
called the real impact of onchain hacks
4:14
a comprehensive study of hack damage
4:16
from 2021 to
4:17
2023 um Mitchell is the uh co- or the
4:21
founder of immuni so he has a lot of
4:24
insight on this this report reminds me
4:26
of a report that I wrote back in 2021
4:28
when I first started getting involved
4:29
with next Mutual about the cost of hacks
4:31
and loss funds but according to Mitchell
4:34
if your protocol gets hacked you should
4:35
expect to lose approximately 16 million
4:38
uh USD see your token price decline by
4:41
52% of its market cap expect press token
4:44
prices to persist for at least six
4:46
months and likely a lot longer and lose
4:49
three months time and effort recovering
4:52
while $16 million is the average points
4:54
out if it's a sophisticated attack or
4:56
it's a larger attack it's likely to be
4:57
10 times higher or larger than that
5:00
um than the average according to uh
5:02
Mitchell it's a very great read and it's
5:04
incredibly informative I highly
5:06
recommend checking that out I'm hoping
5:08
to share something along these lines in
5:09
the future as I start some of my
5:10
research projects for the product and
5:13
risk team within Nexus mutual and on
New Listings
5:16
that note let's talk about some of the
5:17
newest listings in the Nexus Mutual UI
5:20
in the last several weeks we've
5:25
added um cango protocol cover and
5:29
several bundles for cango so we've added
5:32
three bundles in the last week cango and
5:34
Moro blue bundle protocol cover Kango
5:37
and a V3 bundle protocol cover and
5:40
contango and compound V3 bundle protocol
5:42
cover these are the uh most popular
5:45
strategies in the cango markets so you
5:47
can find those in the Nexus Mutual UI
5:50
those will also be added uh sometime
5:53
this week to the open cover UI if you're
5:55
used to buying cover Through open cover
5:57
we've also added bundle protocol cover
5:59
for the new ether file liquid Vault the
6:02
ebtc Bitcoin LRT Vault um we've added
6:06
three other protocol cover listings for
6:08
Reserve Finance credit Guild and RAM
6:10
exchange as well and for the ethery
6:12
liquid vaults you can actually buy cover
6:15
directly in ether's UI they have point
6:17
of sale Integrations in their UI so you
6:19
can buy cover and don't even have to
6:21
leave their UI to buy cover they should
6:23
be adding that ebtc um LRT Vault onal
6:27
protocol cover point of sale integration
6:29
here in the next week or so I haven't
6:31
checked on that yet this week um we're
6:33
also going to be adding some more
6:34
listings this week so keep an eye out
6:36
for upcoming announcements and as always
6:38
if you have a listing you'd like to see
6:40
just ask us to review a potential new
6:41
listing you can send me a DM on X reach
6:44
out to me in the Nexus Mutual Discord or
6:47
send us a message to the contact form on
6:49
the Nexus Mutual
6:51
website we've also had some folks ask
6:53
how we determine what protocols we list
6:55
in the next Mutual UI so I wanted to
6:57
share an overview of that process
6:59
ultimately Nexus Mutual is a risk
7:01
marketplace where Stak and pool managers
7:03
can choose to stake and exam against
7:05
whatever listings they like however if
7:07
we list a new protocol and no one sakes
7:09
against it or the cost of covered is too
7:11
high then it requires work to add the
7:13
listing and no one ends up underwriting
7:15
the protocol protocols with no capacity
7:18
don't show up at the Nexus UI by default
7:20
so it doesn't help anyone to list a
7:21
protocol that no one will stake against
7:24
as the head of the product and risk team
7:26
I conduct due diligence on any potential
7:28
listings we often get get requests from
7:30
protocol teams and from Nexus Mutual
7:32
members to review certain protocols but
7:34
we're also always on the lookout for
7:36
popular protocols and protocols On The
7:37
Rise as well so when we do conduct a
7:40
listing review I always look at a
7:42
protocol as audit history have they been
7:44
audited if so was it by a reputable
7:46
auditor did they actually address the
7:48
findings in um in their audits sometimes
7:51
you'll read through and they'll
7:52
acknowledge certain
7:54
vulnerabilities um they'll say that they
7:56
acknowledge that they're there but
7:57
they're not going to address them
7:58
because they don't think they're much an
7:59
issue so you actually have to see did
8:01
they fix the findings in the audit did
8:03
they address those things so going
8:05
through and reviewing the audit history
8:06
is really important if they haven't been
8:08
audited it's unlikely they're going to
8:09
get listed on Nexus Mutual I also read
8:12
through their documentation understand
8:13
how the protocol Works understand the
8:15
mechanics and see if there's anything
8:17
there that's likely to lead to a
8:19
potential loss um I review the code base
8:21
to determine the quality of the code and
8:23
if there are any claring issues there
8:25
and then take a look at the team are
8:27
they known what is their reputation
8:28
experience
Protocol Listing Decisions
8:30
um you know a little due diligence on
8:31
team members as well as for some of the
8:34
metrics we look for we look for about 10
8:36
to 20 million in tvl as an indicator of
8:38
demand for cover that's kind of our
8:40
Baseline minimum if we list a protocol
8:42
we want to be sure that they're growing
8:44
and there is a sign that there will be
8:45
demand for cover and once I've put
8:48
together all of this information through
8:49
the due diligence process I discuss a
8:51
potential listing with the rest of the
8:52
product through L team if we do desde to
8:55
list then I put together the
8:57
requirements for our engineering team
8:58
and then they get that on chain and the
9:01
front end team gets that in the UI I
9:03
also follow up with the relevant teams
9:05
if I have their contact info and let
9:06
them know that we'll be list in a
9:07
protocol on Nexus Mutual we try to work
9:09
with them on co-marketing see if they're
9:11
interested in a point of sale
9:12
integration uh but if we decide not to
9:14
list I usually reach out and let a team
9:16
or a user know who requested a listing
9:19
um just to let them know why we didn't
9:21
list you know what can be done in the
9:22
future if they um you know if they can
9:24
approve anything or kind of the Baseline
9:26
for why we decided not to list uh but if
9:29
we do list once the listing is live I
9:31
let stiking pool managers know so they
9:32
can decide whether or not to STI get the
9:34
listing and from there we announce new
9:36
listings do some Co marketing and then
9:38
we meet Demand with Supply as more users
9:40
request capacity and buy cover we
9:42
actually have a feature right in the
9:43
Nexus Mutual UI where you can request
9:45
more capacity for a listing and let us
9:48
know what price range you're looking for
9:50
um if you want to buy cover uh even if
9:52
there is capacity and you'd like to see
9:53
a lower price you can request that right
9:55
through the Nexus Mutual UI um so that's
10:00
pretty much the overview of the listing
10:01
process uh any questions on the listing
10:03
process before I move on if you do have
10:06
a question just feel free to raise your
10:07
hand that I can bring you up on uh on
10:10
the space
Governance Updates
10:17
stage okay if not I will move on to some
10:22
updates on the governance side so I have
10:24
a couple of updates here that I'll share
10:27
uh one is about a vote to replace
10:30
a member of The Advisory board so in the
10:32
last month Lee McAn a longtime next
10:36
Mutual contributor nominated himself to
10:38
replace one of the mutuals existing
10:39
Advisory board members uh Nick so Le
10:42
proposal went through the RFC and nmpi
10:45
process and that proposal was put on
10:47
chain for a vote to add Lee to The
10:49
Advisory Board and remov Nick that vote
10:51
was put on chain on uh the previous
10:54
Thursday so that boat was open from
10:56
Thursday to early Sunday and members
10:59
were to approve this nmpi with
11:03
69197 nxm voting to approve Quorum was
11:06
met for this vote so Lee has replaced
11:09
Nick as an Advisory Board member you can
11:11
review the details of this proposal in
11:13
the Nexus Mutual UI and on the
11:15
governance Forum we'll be updating the
11:17
documentation and other places where
11:19
information about The Advisory Board is
11:20
kept as well to reflect this change we
11:23
have another proposal that is on the
11:25
governance Forum it is a dow proposal
11:27
which is going to be going to a snapshot
11:29
vote this week um this nmdp to establish
11:33
carpak is the treasury manager for next
11:35
week will Dow carpak has gone through
11:37
the RFC and nmdp process where they've
11:40
outlined a proposal to act as treasury
11:42
manager for the Nexus Mutual Dow in this
11:44
proposal they've out uh they've outlined
11:47
uh you know what they're proposing which
11:49
is to actively manage 6.5 Million worth
11:52
of assets the breakdown of that would be
11:54
eth and eth derivatives for $2 million
11:57
staple coins for $1.5 million
11:59
and $3 million in wxm and nxm karpaty
12:03
proposes to gradually diversify out of
12:05
wxm and nxm to obtain the balances of
12:09
eth and eth derivatives and stable coins
12:11
specified in their proposal they're also
12:13
going to keep uh wxm and nxm um you know
12:16
not all of that 3 million is going to be
12:18
Diversified out of so in that in total
12:21
it's basically requesting 6.5 Million
12:23
worth of um nxm and W nxm and then
12:27
they'll diversify into basically $2
12:29
million of eth e derivatives and 1.5
12:32
million of stable coins um they've also
12:35
got some suggestion uh for some examples
12:37
of strategies they might uh run but
12:39
ultimately that would be up to another
12:41
governance votes um but Kaki has
12:43
outlined their fee in The Proposal which
12:46
would be a 05% management fee that will
12:49
be charged in nxm or W nxm and um paid
12:52
on a monthly basement and that fee would
12:54
be 0.5% of the net asset value of the
12:58
treasury
12:59
and then a 20% performance fee on the
13:01
yield generated over the last month um
13:05
that'll also be included in their fee
13:07
structure so carpak has outlined
13:10
managing the assets through a
13:11
non-custodial safe which uses this zodac
13:13
rolless modifier module uh for more
13:16
information on the proposal you can head
13:18
to the Forum and check that oute of the
13:20
vote once that vote is live we will be
13:22
announcing thats across our social media
13:24
channels on the Forum and on Discord so
13:26
keep an eye out for those updates um any
13:28
question question on these two
13:29
governance updates before I move
Updates From The Foundation
13:38
on okay if not I will hand things off to
13:41
Hugh so he can give the foundation
13:43
updates H well thanks Brave um yeah
13:46
quite a few things going on um but
13:49
obviously big news today in the Market's
13:50
like with Mead rebranding and stuff so
13:53
if you haven't seen what's going on
13:54
there check it out I plan to get into
13:56
the weeds a bit more after this um but
13:59
yeah so um on to the to the foundation
14:02
update so quite quite a few different
14:04
pieces going on at the moment um we've
14:06
got the UI um updates for staking and
14:09
claims are coming along nicely there's
14:11
quite a lot to it but um but they
14:13
they're looking really good so um that's
14:16
that's progressing well and hopefully we
14:17
we'll see those um soonish um we're
14:21
finalizing a new product um for launch
14:23
over the next week um we're going to
14:26
we're working with open cover on this
14:27
one so um it'll primarily be available
14:30
via the open cover site um so yeah keep
14:32
an eye out for that um hopefully we're
14:35
pretty excited about it but we're going
14:36
to um just do a soft launch to start
14:38
with and then and then push it out more
14:39
widely after that um so yeah keep an eye
14:42
for that one um you may have seen bunch
14:45
of announcements go out um today on the
14:47
the no announcement which is um the node
14:51
operator risk standard so this of of
14:53
staking nodes um for E staking nodes um
14:56
and we've been um heavily involved in
14:58
the development of this standard along
15:00
with people like KPMG coinbase figment
15:03
block demon aluvial and a whole bunch of
15:05
other um people um but we've helped kind
15:08
of shape the the standard there um and
15:11
it's going to like it's basically a risk
15:12
standard saying these are the practices
15:14
that you should um adhere to as kind of
15:16
a um minimum or a reasonable level of um
15:20
risk and operational um to manage the
15:22
risks including operational risk and a
15:23
various various other risks so um we've
15:26
done a lot of work in terms of
15:27
understanding the risks on of State and
15:29
and what um what is actually involved in
15:32
all of that um especially to be able to
15:34
price the product so we we were quite um
15:37
we're helpful in that pulling it all
15:39
together and and driving it Forward into
15:41
into a common standard so that's that's
15:43
a pretty big um piece of work that's
15:44
been going on in the background for a
15:46
while um so yeah good to see that live
15:49
um and I guess in in general um we're
15:52
working with more Partners on the on the
15:54
distribution side of things um I guess
15:57
in particular um one one interesting
16:00
thing over the past few weeks is um we
16:03
will have a product with open cover that
16:04
covers transaction so it's called
16:06
transaction cover basically if you um if
16:09
you are about to sign a transaction it
16:12
gives you a warning if it's a um it's
16:14
got like a screener on it um and if um
16:18
if the screener says it's okay and then
16:20
something bad happens then basically the
16:21
cover the the cover will pay out um so
16:25
they've been they've been working with
16:27
another partner there um Distributing
16:29
that and they've kind of moved out of
16:31
the trial phase and so they've decided
16:32
to double the volumes there so it's
16:35
still relatively small but it's growing
16:37
quite nicely and I think it's a really
16:39
cool product so um hopefully that one um
16:42
will continue to grow the I guess
16:45
another big thing we' I've spent the
16:47
last few weeks doing um we spent like 3
16:50
4 day workshop with one of our new
16:53
distribution Partners we can't actually
16:55
announce yet CU they're still in stealth
16:56
but um we basically is pretty exciting
16:59
for the kind of distribution growth side
17:01
and we we spent a lot of De time going
17:04
through the details of what they need
17:05
from a um a product and um protocol
17:08
point of view um how they can build on
17:11
Nexus um where they can use it um and
17:15
how they can um I guess package it up
17:18
and Market it to to their um
17:20
distribution base as well so um that
17:22
went through a lot of detail and I think
17:24
I'm really excited about this kind of
17:26
partnership and we'll hopefully be able
17:27
to share more um over the coming um
17:30
months so um that that'll that'll be
17:34
that's quite exciting I'm really quite
17:35
excited about that one um so yeah I
17:37
think th those are probably the main
17:39
things but lots of different pieces
17:41
going on um really excited to get new
17:44
products out um and see how they go um
17:47
this transaction cover stuff is really
17:48
exciting and and hopefully this new um
17:51
new product which we'll announce next
17:53
week hopefully um we'll attract some
17:56
good volumes as well so yeah um lots of
17:58
