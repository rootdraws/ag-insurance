Welcome to the step-by-step guide on
0:08
purchasing bundled protocol cover. In
0:11
this video, we'll show you how to find
0:13
and buy bundled protocol cover, which
0:16
offers the same comprehensive protection
0:18
as our standard protocol cover, but
0:21
applies the protection to multiple
0:23
protocols under one listing. Let's get
0:26
started.
0:30
Step one, access the UI at app.n
0:34
nexusmutual.io.
0:37
First, go to app.n nexusmutual.io.
0:41
To proceed with a purchase, you will
0:43
need to connect your wallet and be a
0:46
member of the mutual. Not a member yet?
0:49
No problem. You can still explore
0:51
listings and check pricing before
0:53
joining us.
0:56
Step two, search for listings.
1:00
On the cover section of the UI, you will
1:03
see a list of cover options. By default,
1:06
public listings available to all users
1:09
are displayed.
1:12
If you're looking for a specific
1:13
protocol or category, let's see how you
1:16
can find it. Use the search bar to
1:19
quickly find a protocol.
1:22
You can also browse by category or
1:25
product type using the drop- down menus.
1:29
Each listing shows key details.
1:32
Annual cover fee, the cost of coverage
1:35
per year, available capacity, the amount
1:39
of cover available.
1:42
If a listing has no available capacity,
1:46
click request capacity and submit the
1:49
form. The product and risk team will
1:52
reach out via email.
1:56
Step three, generate quote. Once you
2:00
found the bounder protocol cover listing
2:02
you're looking for, click on it to see
2:04
more details. Enter your cover amount,
2:06
set the cover period, and carefully
2:08
review the terms and conditions. This
2:11
section also includes a list of the
2:13
protocols that are included in the
2:15
bundle.
2:18
Double check the cover amount, period,
2:20
and cost in the overview section to the
2:22
right. Adjust slippage if necessary.
2:26
Select your payment method from the
2:29
drop-down under cover cost. Ensure your
2:32
wallet is connected and that spending is
2:35
approved for the required amount.
2:38
Finally, click purchase cover and
2:40
confirm the transaction in your wallet.
2:44
That's it. Your cover is now active. You
2:48
can manage your covers anytime from the
2:50
your covers section on the main cover
2:53
page of the UI as well.
