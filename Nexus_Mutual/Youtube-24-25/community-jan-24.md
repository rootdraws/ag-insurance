2023 Q4 Insights Report Highlights
4:12
thrilled to present the Nexus Mutual
4:14
Dows Q4 2023 insights
4:18
report this quarter has been
4:20
transformative for us we have marked
4:23
significant strides and cover sales
4:25
investment earnings and much more
4:27
including um the toonomic
4:30
projects launch um it set the stage for
4:33
continued
4:35
growth in addition we established a
4:38
partnership with covery to underwrite a
4:40
broader range of real world risks all
4:43
the while members continued to manage
4:46
Risk by staking nxm in various staking
4:49
pools and they earned rewards in
4:52
parallel in addition we paid out
4:56
claims you can find the full report at
4:59
the next Mutual Forum to take a look at
5:01
the details within each section but to
5:05
recap with some of the highlights in Q4
5:08
we achieved over $58 million in cover
5:11
sales this is a testament to our
5:13
community's trust and the increasing
5:15
demand for our
5:18
products interesting to note we've seen
5:20
a strategic shift away from relying
5:23
solely on protocol cover we embraced a
5:25
more sustainable partnership framework
5:28
that fortifies our position as def's
5:30
leading risk marketplace with Partners
5:33
such as Sherlock Li at Collective and
5:35
the retail
5:36
Mutual our Capital pool Investments have
5:39
been fruitful generating over $1.2
5:42
million in rewards for our members and
5:45
55% of the capital pool is currently
5:48
generating yield through Stak e
5:50
investment allocations that are done in
5:53
a diversified
5:55
manner moreover our commitment to
5:59
process processing claims has led to the
6:02
approval and payment of almost
6:06
$300,000 worth of claims to members who
6:08
suffered
6:09
losses this reinforces our pledged to
6:14
our community's support and Security in
6:19
defi if we look at the numbers that tell
6:22
the story of our last quarter we see
6:25
again that our cover sales have reached
6:27
an impressive 58 $8.3
6:31
million from these sales our members
6:34
earned about
6:36
$29,900 in cover
6:40
fees like pointed out the investment
6:43
strategy paid off
6:46
well in addition the Dow benefited from
6:49
commissions earning over $20,000 which
6:52
contributes to our operational
6:54
sustainability and is a is an example of
6:58
dedicated front end can utilize
7:01
commissions to boost
7:03
earnings last but not least the retting
7:06
amm buyback brought in a significant
7:09
value of over $5.3 million for
7:13
members this is only one way that
7:17
toonomic strategy showcases its
7:22
success zooming out to the entire year
7:25
the figures are even more
7:27
telling our covers sales are about $359
7:32
million with cover fees exceeding $1.3
7:35
million even in this year's bare Market
7:38
the mutual remained profitable increased
7:40
Capital pool Investments and expanded
7:43
into new
7:44
markets I'm personally really proud of
7:46
the team and our members and quite
7:48
excited for
7:51
2024 as our road map is clear with a
7:54
clear focus on expanding our product
7:56
offerings enhancing our platform and
7:59
deepening our community
8:02
engagement at this point I want to hand
8:04
things over to bra with whom I worked
8:06
together to prepare this report to share
8:09
some final
8:11
remarks on the
8:13
report
8:16
Brave just wanted to say that D5 moves
8:19
so fast and it's really easy to overlook
8:21
everything we've accomplished in
8:23
2023 uh just as a recap in the last year
8:26
um we launched V2 which allowed people
8:28
to build risk management businesses on
8:29
top of the protocol and expand cover
8:31
distribution like some pointed out we've
8:33
seen e Sherlock Uno and unity cover as
8:36
the primary staking pool managers in
8:38
addition to Hughes personal staking pool
8:41
open cover launched in September of 2023
8:43
and open cover has been helping
8:44
distribute Nexus Mutual protocol cover
8:46
on l2s like Bas optimism and arbitrum uh
8:50
we saw 8.8 million paid out in claims to
8:52
people who lost funds in FTX blockfi
8:55
Gemini Oiler and other smaller claim
8:57
events and from that the mutual has
8:59
already recovered 2.3 million in funds
9:01
from claimants who are reimbursed or
9:04
transfer their bankruptcy claims to the
9:05
mutual we're expecting additional
9:07
recoveries as well and the foundation
9:09
legal team is working hard to recover
9:10
funds where reimbursement was made
9:13
available to claimants so that they're
9:15
not benefiting from two payouts from any
9:17
claim event so the Mandate that the
9:20
foundation legal team has through nmpi
9:23
205 um is to work and recover uh
9:26
reimbursements where possible to get
9:29
those back into the capital pool we've
9:32
expanded into real world risk with the
9:33
retail Mutual cover and the cover Redal
9:36
which are both pretty groundbreaking for
9:38
a defi coverage protocol bridging
9:40
onchain Capital to offchain markets um
9:44
we've updated some cover products and
9:46
launch some new cover products we
9:47
launched the toonomic tokenomics upgrade
9:49
after our members approved n mpip 209 so
9:53
now members have been able to redeem
9:55
their nxm for eth and 355 members have
9:57
redeemed nxm for e to date you can see
10:00
that summary in the complete Q4 insights
10:03
report as well as in past issues the
10:05
Hedge nxm and wxm have been within 1% of
10:09
each other since the tokenomics upgrade
10:11
um when that was completed in November
10:13
and right now there's about a 0.5%
10:15
difference between the open market price
10:17
and the nxm price for the Rams price
10:20
Discovery mechanism as s pointed out nxm
10:22
holders earned um as of right now about
10:25
5.4 million through the automated
10:27
BuyBacks as the Ram has that price
10:30
Discovery mechanism um and that happened
10:32
during the initial exit period so
10:35
there's a lot that we have in store for
10:36
2024 there's a lot that we've
10:38
accomplished in 2023 I would recommend
10:40
everybody to check out the road map that
10:42
we have on the forum for um some alall
10:44
and things we're working on in 2024 as
10:46
well as looking at the Q4 insights
10:48
report um 2023 was a really great year
10:51
for the mutual and you know even in a
10:54
low yield environment even with a large
10:56
amount of claim payouts the mutual still
10:57
saw a net profit of over $4.1 million in
11:01
2023 I think through a lot of the work
11:04
that we're going to be doing to increase
11:06
growth in
11:07
2024 um investing more of the available
11:10
float in the capital pool growing our
11:12
community and getting more active Dow
11:15
contributors and um active Dow community
11:17
members I think we can expect another
11:19
promising year of capital pool and DOW
11:21
treasury growth um again I highly
11:23
recommend everyone read through these
11:25
reports in the road map it's a really
11:26
great overview and provides a nice look
11:28
back at on
11:30
2023 um we're happy to take any
11:32
questions that anybody might have uh on
11:34
Discord or on the Forum about these
11:36
reports or the road map and I'm really
11:39
looking forward to community feedback on
11:41
these things um but yeah there's a lot
11:43
that we have to
11:44
celebrate but if there are no questions
11:46
I'll hand things over to Hugh to share
11:48
some updates from the foundation
11:53
H cool thanks guys um yeah really good
Foundation Team Updates
11:56
really good report um get into the
11:57
details if you're interested there's
11:59
there's a decent amount of stuff in
12:00
there um yeah so an update on the key
12:03
things from the foundation side as um as
12:06
was mentioned we're working on cover um
12:09
so that that's I guess it's been agreed
12:11
at a high level members have agreed but
12:12
we're just going through the due
12:13
diligence um side of things and looking
12:15
to sign contracts over the coming weeks
12:18
and then um the upgrades that are
12:20
required to actually execute um this my
12:23
contract upgrades that are required they
12:25
should go live um in the next few weeks
12:28
as well um and then we can actually make
12:30
the um make the kind of investment which
12:32
is the kind of stage one of um of the
12:35
relationship and then we'll be looking
12:38
um over the coming months to then um
12:40
implement the the retrocession part of
12:43
it where they um W up a retransfer risk
12:45
um into the mutual so I'm looking
12:46
forward to kind of pulling all that
12:48
together um in the kind of first half
12:50
first um you know maybe late second
12:52
quarter or um second quarter of this
12:55
year so we'll have to see on the timing
12:57
but um but that's that's what we're Hing
12:58
to do so that's that's going
13:00
well the um I guess the other thing um
13:03
on just to add on the on the recovery so
13:07
the FTX recoveries are going quite well
13:09
so um we've made some indicative sales
13:13
of um some of some of the claims some of
13:15
the larger ones um and so we're looking
13:17
to hopefully finalize that over the next
13:18
few weeks um that won't be all of the re
13:21
uh recoveries but um it'll be be a chunk
13:24
of them and and the rest will um they're
13:26
a bit smaller so we'll probably leave
13:27
them um for a while um and and see how
13:30
see how it plays out um with valuation
13:33
Etc so um a lot of legal work on that
13:36
side but it's going well we should
13:38
expect some some decent recoveries um to
13:40
come through so um so that's good news
13:43
um I guess there's also we're also
13:45
working on some product development um
13:47
side of things some coming up with some
13:48
new products with some new partners um I
13:50
can't share full details right now but
13:52
um that's going really really well um
13:54
and it's definitely a promising new
13:56
product and and so hopefully um that has
13:58
some success behind it over the um first
14:00
half of this year um I guess on the more
14:04
Dev side UI is still um being being
14:08
worked on we um we've just been
14:10
distracted by a few other little bits
14:12
and pieces with covery and and other
14:13
stuff going on but um but the UI review
14:15
is is still ongoing so um we'll give you
14:18
I'll give you more updates when we have
14:19
a bit more certainty on the time frame
14:21
and I guess the after cover read one of
14:24
the bigger pieces we're picking up is um
14:26
cover edits so ability to edit the um
14:29
amount and length of the the cover um
14:32
which would be useful for many people I
14:33
think so um so that's kind of the key
14:36
stuff on the um development side of
14:38
things I guess personally one thing I'm
14:41
also looking at um in a bit of details
14:44
is um considering some of the the
14:47
parameters that we've we launched with
14:49
um with V2 not necessarily to not
14:51
tokenomics but um the V2 parameters have
14:53
been live for about a year um and
14:56
there's there's one one in particular
14:59
that that we may want to um look at
15:00
reviewing so I'm going to have a little
15:02
bit of analysis on that and maybe put up
15:03
a forum post to um to get people's um
15:06
input on that so um I guess look out for
15:08
that one um as well so I think that's
15:12
the that's the main stuff um if you've
15:15
yeah if you've got any questions happy
15:16
to take them now or um on Discord or St
15:19
later thanks thanks
15:22
you let's move on with a review of the
15:25
new protocol cover listings with brave
New Protocol Cover Listings
15:30
thanks Sam yeah if you haven't already
15:33
noticed we've been adding more protocol
15:34
cover listings in the Nexus Mutual UI in
15:37
recent weeks we've added protocol cover
15:39
listings for uh pendall ien layer Stak
15:43
wise V3 hyper liquid compound V3 urine
15:46
V3 vrone V3 GMX V2 D hedge term finance
15:52
and Aerodrome you can see some of those
15:55
featured on this slide we'll be adding
15:57
new listings in the coming weeks as well
15:59
the next listing that you can expect to
16:00
see in the UI will be for Maverick
16:02
protocol uh I've been highlighting these
16:04
listings on the Nexus Mutual Twitter
16:06
account as well and we've seen a big
16:07
increase in Impressions now that we're
16:09
posting regular content every day and
16:11
featuring listings on a daily basis so
16:15
far the listings that we've pred on
16:16
Twitter over the last month have seen uh
16:18
roughly 8.65 million in cover buys come
16:21
through which have brought in a little
16:23
bit more than 43,000 in cover fees over
16:25
that time frame we're also working with
16:27
open cover on co-marketing initiatives
16:29
to make more folks aware that they can
16:31
buy NEX Mutual protocol cover on l2s
16:33
through open cover so with open cover
16:35
people don't need to be members to buy
16:37
protection through open cover they can
16:39
just purchase protection on l2s with
16:40
lower gas fees while enjoying the same
16:42
comprehensive coverage that we offer on
16:45
ethereum through the official Nexus
16:47
Mutual UI so look out for an
16:49
announcement later this week about
16:50
upcoming Twitter spaces we'll be hosting
16:52
with open cover in BP Finance on
16:54
Wednesday February 7th we'll also be
16:56
hosting another Twitter spaces the week
16:58
after on Wednesday February 14th with
17:01
open cover in GMX to talk about the GMX
17:04
V2 listing um open covers uh
17:07
availability to buy GMX V1 and V2 cover
17:11
and what the GMX team is working on so
17:15
keep an eye out for those new listing
17:16
announcements on our Twitter account
17:18
open covers Twitter account and on our
17:21
Discord server if there's a protocol
17:23
that you would like to see listed reach
17:24
out to us in the purchasing cover or
17:27
members Lounge channels on Discord and
17:28
ask us to review a protocol for a
17:31
listing um we're always happy to
17:33
evaluate new listings that our members
17:35
would like to see in the
17:37
UI and I did just want to quickly note
17:40
on the slide as well um you know that I
17:43
think protocol cover is really important
17:44
and given that we've seen over 125
17:46
million exploits just since this year
17:49
started but the most recent hack
17:50
happening just this morning on
17:52
Abracadabra protocol for about 7 million
17:55
it's never been more important to
17:56
protect the productive crypto against um
17:59
these really big risks in defi so I
18:01
think people should take a look at what
18:03
we have listed in the UI um look at you
18:07
know availability uh for capacity if
18:09
there isn't enough capacity you can
18:10
reach out to us and we can reach out to
18:12
the staking pool managers to see if we
18:14
can get capacity opened up for you um
18:16
but I think people should make protocol
18:17
cover a core part of their portfolio
18:19
management practices um so that you know
18:22
when hacks happen it doesn't set you
18:24
back you don't lose a significant amount
18:25
of funds I'm always happy to answer
18:28
question question about protocol cover
18:29
or any list of protocol on Discord or
18:31
Twitter as well so definitely reach out
18:33
if you have questions or you want to
18:35
learn more about protocol cover
18:37
protections or about what is covered
18:39
when you purchase protocol cover for a
18:41
specific
18:42
protocol so on that I think we can move
18:45
to the next
RFC Status Update: oSnap Integration with the DAO Treasury
18:48
slide I also wanted to give a quick
18:50
update on the RFC about o snap that the
18:52
Uma team has posted on the Forum I
18:55
imagine this is going to transition to a
18:57
formal nmd piece soon so everybody
18:59
should read through the proposal and ask
19:01
any questions or share their thoughts
19:03
but for those of you who aren't familiar
19:04
with osnap osnap is infrastructure built
19:06
on top of safe that was developed by Uma
19:10
um this allows people to create uh a
19:13
snapshot vote for a dow that has a
19:15
transaction payload uh for example the
19:18
Dow teams funding proposal would be a
19:20
good example of what could be used for a
19:21
votes so if a vote with the payload is
19:24
approved osnap can automatically send
19:26
the funds from a safe multi-sig per the
19:30
snapshot proposal specifications so that
19:32
could be sent from the Dow treasury to
19:34
the recipient or the recipients after a
19:37
vote closes this reduces dependencies on
19:40
Dow multi6 signers and allows Dows to
19:42
further decentralize their snapshot
19:44
governance procedures even if they're
19:46
using a safe multi- to custody funds
19:49
osnap also allows people to dispute out
19:52
outcomes um and there are security
19:55
measures in place to prevent abuse as
19:56
well I've outlined some options in a
19:59
comment on that post where members can
20:02
um set the o snap parameters and set
20:04
snapshot parameters to make the process
20:06
more secure and pre prevent any abuse or
20:10
any malicious proposals from coming
20:11
through um you can see those on the next
20:18
slide but just to give you an idea um
20:20
with o snap you have like what the
20:22
Quorum is there is a quorum feature in
20:25
snapshot as well that you can Implement
20:27
um I've suggested a 50,000 nxm Quorum
20:31
amount um so that any Vault would need a
20:35
significant amount of nxm to pass uh the
20:38
voting period I think the minimum voting
20:40
period should be 5 days that's typically
20:42
what we do for our Dow team proposals um
20:45
it's what I suggest for people that's
20:47
what we have in the guidelines for the
20:49
nmtp process for Snapchat votes and the
20:52
challenge period here I've suggested is
20:54
36 hours this would be the time between
20:57
a vote Clos cling and a vote being
21:00
executed that 36 hours can be used to
21:02
open a dispute through Uma and then the
21:06
um Uma voters through their optimistic
21:09
Oracle can review and then vote on the
21:11
outcome so they would be checking to see
21:14
if the transaction payload matches the
21:18
specifications in a given
21:21
proposal so the above parameters that I
21:24
have in this comment um are specific to
21:26
oap the other one ones about um proposal
21:29
validation are just specific to snapshot
21:33
so we can have a uh a certain threshold
21:37
for anyone putting up a proposal or the
21:40
other option is to have um specific
21:43
admins or mods on the snapshot space
21:46
that are the only ones that can open up
21:48
proposals um one of them is a little bit
21:50
more uh permissionless one of them is a
21:52
little bit more gated but it really is
21:54
up to members I don't have any specific
21:57
preference on that I would love to see
21:59
members kind of discuss this and share
22:01
their opinions on what options would be
22:03
best if osnap were
22:05
implemented um I'd like to say that I'm
22:07
overall supportive of this proposal I
22:09
look forward to seeing it transition to
22:11
an nmdp however I would like to see
22:13
other members share their thoughts on
22:14
the governance forum and provide
22:16
feedback on this RFC before it goes to a
22:19
dow proposal if anybody has any
22:21
questions I'm happy to answer them now
22:23
or you can share your questions on the
22:24
Forum and Bobby who has been the one
22:27
that's been posting and has been
22:28
answering from Uma um we'll be able to
22:31
answer them for you he's been really
22:32
fast at responding on the Forum so far
22:34
and if you drop a question Discord um I
22:37
can let him know and he can answer that
22:39
as
22:39
well but um but yeah I highly recommend
22:42
everybody check that out um I think o
22:44
snap is a really cool feature and it's
22:46
something that we could definitely
22:47
benefit from but if there are no
22:49
questions on osnap I'll pass things back
22:51
to Sam thanks bra let's look at the last
Last Week in Numbers

23:08
left we have seen new product listings
