well so open cover is a distributor
0:06

0:12
optimism
0:13
arbitrum um and I wanted to highlight
0:15
them because they've grown quite a bit
0:17
in Q2 so we're working on our um Q2
0:21
insights report for 2024 but I wanted to
0:24
give you a preview of some of the growth
0:25
that open cover has seen since they've
0:27
boosted their cover sales by 112% since
0:30
q1 of this year in Q2 open cover sold
0:34
6.32 million in cover and they earned
0:36
the mutual of 44k in premium through 180
0:40
cover sales with an average of 60 covers
0:42
per month as more users move to l2s to
0:45
participate in defi having partners like
0:47
open cover and the Nexus Mutual
0:48
ecosystem is incredibly powerful open
0:51
cover is also um they've kind of move to
0:54
The Syndicate layer they have their own
0:56
staking pool and they are you know
0:59
working to expand their offerings as
1:01
well but open cover is offering users a
1:04
solution for those who don't want to kyc
1:06
or those who are looking to buy smaller
1:08
covers and and want to be able to buy
1:10
covers somewhere where the gas costs
1:12
aren't going to make it cost prohibited
1:13
for them so they're providing a really
1:15
great alternative to joining the mutual
1:17
as a member and instead using open cover
1:20
this layer that's built on top of us
1:21
that's going to help us scale retail
1:23
cover sales so they've also been working
1:26
on a new product as well which can help
1:28
the mutual sell a significant amount of
1:29
cost cover in the coming years they are
1:31
very laser focused on growth um I was
1:34
just talking with Jeremiah from open
1:35
cover earlier today and they have a lot
1:36
in the pipeline so they're focused on
1:38
growth just like the foundation and DOW
1:40
teams and I'm really looking forward to
1:42
working with open cover in Q3 and Beyond
1:45
if you haven't heard of open cover
1:46

1:48
