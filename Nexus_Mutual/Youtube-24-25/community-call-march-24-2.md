[Music] Welcome to our community call we hold
0:09
these calls every other Tuesday and we used to hold these calls on Discord but we decided to experiment
0:16
with X and see how it goes um I'll briefly talk about what we're going to
0:21
do today and then hand things over to grave and Hugh who is joining us from the Nexus Mutual main account
Agenda
0:28
today and um we'll get things started with a brief overview of the defi Market
0:36
these days you know things have been busy things have been cooking on various ends and then we'll have um Brave recap
0:46
his highlights from the state of yields and defi report which um gained quite a
0:51
lot of interest in the past few weeks and then um we'll hear from Hugh U about
0:58
governance updates and and he'll also give us an update from the foundation side of things we'll review the last
1:05
week in numbers and ask any open questions to the listeners and meanwhile
1:11
please do interrupt us if you have any questions anywhere um H and brave will'll also make sure that we answer
1:18
any questions throughout the call so yeah um Brave your state of defi report
1:25
how has that idea came about and what are your findings um please take the
BraveNewDeFi's State of DeFi Yields Report
1:34
stage yeah uh good morning everybody um just wanted to say for those of you who uh are new to our community call my name
1:40
is brave neifi and I am headed of community over at Nexus but I also work uh in a few
1:46
other areas within the mutual um one of which is on the product and rist team and uh I get a lot of people that ask me
1:52
about you know um what yields are like in defi what the risks are how to get
1:58
involved what protocols we have listed and I go through usually every week and do a review of um what what's the
2:06
available yield in defi I kind of track the market looking at like a baseline rate to see how things are climbing up a
2:13
lot of what we looked at last year is we saw that protocol cover sales weren't as robust as they had been in previous years but we were in a bare market and
2:20
that base rate was around two or three% so there wasn't kind of that push or that incentive for people to deploy
2:26
Capital uh on chain because you know you could earn y old offchain and something like a u in us treasuries for
2:33
considerably less risk so to get that Capital that moved offchain back onchain
2:40
you kind of want to see that base rate and defi climb up over time so after all
2:45
people that asked me this I just thought well why don't I just write um a report each week and put that out so the first
2:51
one I did was a couple weeks ago and I called it the state of uh defi yields and it was so popular when I first put
2:57
it out just as a post on Twitter that I started publishing it on mirror and I published the first one last week so I
3:04
thought I'd go through and give an overview talk about how cover fits in to some of these defi yield strategies and
3:10
just talk about the state of yield within Defi and kind of give an overview on the community call the day one tool I
3:16
wanted to highlight too that I've been using is there are you know some great different yield aggregators that you can
3:21
find where they kind of give you an overlay of where to yield is in defy one of the handy ones I found is a site
3:28
called vault. FYI um this is built by the wall facer Labs team and this will give you kind of
3:35
insight on like yields in year a compound uh
3:42
Athena hop you know a lot of these well-known protocols and it gives you a good idea of like what the base rate in
3:48
defi is so when I first started this the base rate was around maybe like 10%
3:53
between Staples and eth last week it was creeping up more toward 15% and looking
3:59
at it today the the trailing 7-Day average apy is closer like 18% so it's
4:05
very clear there's a lot of Leverage in the market right now and people are very bullish um on on eth and other Crypton
4:11
native assets um so I highlight that a lot in the report and that's kind of what I Ed to figure out what the base rate is in
4:18
defi looking at stable coin yields um a lot of the rates you're
4:23
going to see pretty much dominated a lot right now by the a V2 and a V3 markets
4:29
as well as some of the compound B3 markets just looking today um you know for anybody that's using a or is looking
4:38
at yields on there um like the optimism Market I've noticed has had like significantly high
4:43
yields and the uh SSD market and the LUSD Market on a have been really high
4:51
but currently the supply apy for susd on the optimism Market with an a V3 is at
4:58
97% um so there's some pretty high utilization among SD uh usdt usdc and D
5:07
across a lot of these lending markets and usdc on compound V3 is also quite
5:12
High uh in the report I wrote last week I talked a little bit about the interest rate curve changes that a and compound
5:18
have made in the last year and the impact that's had on rates um but I mean you can see it's pretty apparent that
5:24
there's a lot of a lot of people using leverage and there's High utilization in The Lending markets so that's one driver
5:30
of some of these yields I talk a bit about LP strategies for stable coins using things like Aerodrome bad Drome um
5:38
both of which are X's that are on l2s valdrome of course is on optimism and
5:43
Aerodrome is on Bas I'm sure everyone's heard about Aerodrome this week with the news about um coinbase taking a position
5:51
in Aerodrome and being more vocal about that and kind of thinking that their primary decks for the base ecosystem and
5:58
I talked a lot of about kind of the eth base rate as well and so for eth the
6:03
base rate is always going to be essentially staking yield um so liquid staking tokens provide between 3 to
6:11
4% um a year but a lot of what we've seen driving yields on eth have been the
6:17
liquid reaking protocols so Ian layer with all of the stuff built on top of it
6:22
Ian layer with their points ethery with their points kelp Dow and Renzo and um
6:30
offer Finance with their points so it's like points on points on points and people are farming these points and that
6:37
speculation on what these points are worth is driving a lot of the yields in those strategies especially with pendall
6:43
so pendall has been really popular for cover buys here in the last couple weeks and the yields there on eth I mean if
6:50
you put in like e e from ethery and you put that in there you can get a fixed um apy from people who want
6:59
to strip out the yield tokens and for those of you who don't know how penda works it's basically a yield stripping
7:04
protocol so you put in a yield bearing token and it strips out one side where you get the yield token which represents
7:09
the yield being earned on that in the case of like ethery it's the points that are being acred um and on the other side
7:16
you have that principal token which is the uh underlying assets backing the eth and so with that you can put in your e
7:24
strip out the yield sell it to somebody and they'll pay you a fixed apy those have been ranging between like 30 and
7:29
40% so on eth that's that's a pretty attractive yield which is why we've seen more people gravitating over to pendall
7:36
I talk about the growth kind of in the igen layer ecosystem and I also note that there actually is no yield being
7:41
produced by those things and it's all pretty much speculation driven by points um and so I kind of give this broad
7:47
overview in there about a lot of the protocols I talk about gearbox and their leverage strategies and while I just
7:55
would say if you haven't used leverage before and you're not familiar with it probably not a good thing to mess around with you definitely don't want to wipe
8:01
out your defi yields because you get liquidated but on the passive side within gearbox because there's been such
8:06
high demand for leverage on E main net um you know you can earn like 20% apy on
8:13
E deposits in the passive markets and so all that being said there is a lot of yield opportunity out there but there's
DeFi Risks Review
8:19
also you know there are also significant risks depositing into certain protocols
8:24
in defi um I'm sure most people on the call are familiar with the risks if you've heard about NEX Mutual before but
8:31
there are two primary risks which I always like to just give an overview of one is the technical risk of putting
8:36
money into a protocol and that's the exposure to Smart contract risk or external dependencies like Bridge
8:42
infrastructure and so there there could be something like a reeny attack which we saw last year um with the actual
8:49
Viper compiler which affected some of the curve liquidity pools um that was a
8:54
re-entrancy attack that is a pretty well-known attack factor and that's been pling defi since I mean broadly 2020 but
9:02
I mean that goes all the way back to the Dow hack in 2016 so you know there are these risks
9:08
when you're depositing in that there could be a flaw in the smart contract code that can be exploited and funds can be stolen so there's that one side and
9:16
the other side is the economic risk um you know there's Market risk which is not something that that Nexus covers but
9:23
there is the risk of bad DEA crewing into an A or compound or any lending market and this is can be by severe
9:30
liquidation failure if liquidations don't occur and bad debt builds up a bad debt can also build up um if
9:35
liquidations don't occur on a timely fashion um that can create bad debt in in one of these markets um there could
9:42
be a dpeg event which is not something that we currently cover but it's something we're exploring um a deeg event like we saw with us or usdc and
9:50
then Oracle failure or Oracle manipulation attacks um you know somebody can try and manipulate the
9:56
sources for a price feed and um Drive prices out of whack which can be used to
10:02
exploit and drain a lending protocol or you know a different protocol we've seen it in the past that's what caused the
10:08
urine wi die hack that we covered in 2021 so there's a you know quite a few
10:14
different kinds of risks and we could go really deep into the complexity of it but there's actually a lot of resources
10:19
in our documentation about that I'm always happy to answer questions about it um but with protocol cover you can
10:24
actually buy coverage and protect against a lot of those main risks so we cover smart contract um you know flaws
10:33
that cause losses due to Smart contract um code flaws so essentially hacks and
10:39
exploits we cover severe Oracle failure or Oracle manipulation severe liquidation failure um and we cover
10:46
losses that occur if there's a governance takeover and funds are taken out of a smart contract so these are
10:53
primarily like the largest risks in defi um and we've paid out over 18 million in claims uh to date since the Mutual has
11:01
launched we paid out for the RAR um fuse hack in 2022 we paid out for the oiler
11:07
hack last year we've paid out for some custody events like FTX Holden not
11:12
Gemini blockfi um we've paid out for the cream exploit in 2021 and again the
11:18
urine exploit in 2021 and the first hack we ever paid out for was bzx bzx in 2020
11:26
so we have paid out claims in the past we have helped a lot of people recoup their losses so that you know a hack
11:32
didn't significantly set them back um but you know these risks are real and uh you know just last year 1.7 billion was
11:39
lost due to ax according to amuni report and just in January and February there's
11:45
been almost 190 million loss due to ax so while you're deploying funds in this bare market and earning yield um I would
11:51
highly encourage you to look at protocol cover look at options to protect your deposits you can use things like open
11:57
cover um you can use use Nexus Mutual on mainten if you're a member but open cover is actually built on top of Nexus
12:03
mutual and allows you to buy you know the same comprehensive coverage but on an L2 you can buy coverage through open
12:10
cover on Bas arbitrum or optimism so you know you can be deploying capital on l2s
12:16
where we see a lot of activity shifting due to high transaction fees on Main net you can buy coverage and protect your
12:21
deposit for you know a fraction of the cost because you're saving a lot on the gas fees so highly encourage every
12:27
everyone to check that out um the next state of defi yields report is going to come out this Friday always
12:34
Happ to take questions on that you can find that pinned in my uh in my profile on Twitter you can also find it on
12:41
mirror um and I can move on and talk about some new listings but I just thought I'd stop and see if anybody had
12:47
any questions or any comments they wanted to speak on um about the state of defi yields report or anything
Recent Protocol Cover Listings
12:53
broader okay if not I can talk about some of the recent protocol cover listings we've added
12:59
um in the last couple months we've added quite a few new listings so we've added Maverick protocol equilibria which is
13:06
built on top of Pendle it's like the convex to curve in the Pendle ecosystem
13:12
we've uh launched coverage for nft per PX e Camelot V3 D hedge gearbox V3
13:21
Aerodrome and velodrome hyper liquid GMX V2 igen layer um and a few others I have
13:28
a lot more listings coming up um we definitely want to you know list new protocols where
13:35
people are deploying Capital um where you know users want to purchase protection and protect their deposits
13:41
for we definitely want to stay on the edge of things as new things are launching and there's new yield strategies so that we can help make defi
13:48
a safer place to transact and earn in 2024 um and again we've seen a lot of
13:53
demand for covers related to liquid reaking tokens as that's where a lot of yield opportunity has been for eth in
13:59
the last few weeks um but if there's any protocols that you'd like to buy cover for that aren't listed um just send me a
14:06
DM or reach out to us on Discord we're always happy to review protocols for a listing um and we basically do listing
14:14
reviews and put up new listings every week so if there's anything that you'd like to see listed just uh give me a
14:20
holler but uh yeah I'm happy to take any questions here otherwise I can turn it back over to
14:27
s thanks bra it's definitely worth a read
14:34
um if any of the listeners haven't yet checked out bra's comprehensive and clear report uh please do I think it has
14:41
a lot of covered Alpha in it and if you have any questions please do reach out to
14:47
us right now I want to turn things over to Hugh who is joining us from the Nexus Mutual main account Hugh is our CEO as
14:55
many of you might know and he's going to give us a brief brief update from the foundation team uh also we have a recent
15:02
proposal up on the Forum that uh where we're in h proposes to change the
15:08
pricing parameter so that um it is easier to buy cover so yeah Hugh please
Foundation Team Updates
15:15
take it away happy to hear your comments on the market side of things as
15:21
well everyone thanks Sam and brave um yeah let's go what's going on on the on the foundation side obviously things are
15:27
starting to heat up more generally with um price or number going up um always helps so yeah lot lots more interest um
15:36
from our main product but also a lot of um ad hoc or more kind of like tailored deals type stuff going on in the
15:42
background so um we're responding to those as the as the foundation team quite a lot um one thing that um is
15:50
interesting we actually do have some some real world coverage out there as well um through the retail Mutual they
15:56
they cover some some shop owners and stuff in the in the UK and so um they've always got a few requests about how to
16:02
increase things and and move on from there so we're also dealing with some of that stuff as well um I guess more on
16:08
the crypto um side where um we're the we're kind of
16:13
internally testing uh an update to the UI at the moment um which is um which is pretty exciting and we're also looking
16:20
and we're also in the process of of building out and speaking exactly how we can make um I guess cover buying a lot
16:27
easier andot closer to the to the kind of I guess what I call the primary action so like where the user actually
16:34
deposits into def or does something um so make it much easier to integrate um coule pies you know and not just on l1's
16:41
on on l2s and stuff as well so looking at um some tech Solutions there which are um we've got some initial um design
16:49
specs and everything and so it's looking um really positive so I'm excited to kind of bring that um bring that to to
16:55
Market over the over the coming months so there's there's quite a lot going on on the foundation side um when it um
17:01
comes to the the sales side the engineering side and and I guess some all the other um outside of crypto as
17:07
well so I guess lots of things going on there um more broadly I guess in the markets
17:15
obviously things have been um when the number go up everyone everyone wants to
17:20
everyone's more happy to pay for um interest rates to to lead up and everything so a lot of the yields are
17:26
increasing across the border as Brave was saying um it's interesting to see the um all
17:32
the reaking points and everything go um obviously very popular right now um I
17:38
guess we have to wait and see what happens they excited to see when actual evss go live on the reaking um side of
17:45
things I actually think more generally that's a really good opportunity for for Nexus because each of those reaking um
17:51
abss is going to have their own slashing conditions on top of the restake de um so that applies to the restake
17:59
so that there can be like um slashing coverage um products built on um for that as well and I think it's going to
18:05
be really interesting because that means there's going to be higher yields and more opportunity for um places where um
18:12
I guess the the net yield after the cost to cover makes sense and so and so that's been um a large part of that
18:17
success so yeah so really kind of excited to see how the the reaking markets um develop over the coming
18:23
months and years um so yeah I think um it's I guess it's an exciting time and
18:30
the The Narrative shift has been shifting a bit recently so it's good to see um that's that's kind of the main
NMPIP-213 Overview
18:38
stuff on the on the foundation side of things um on the um government side so
18:44
just wanted to give everyone um a bit of an update um I put a proposal up um personally put a proposal up on um The
18:51
Forum to change one of the pricing parameters I guess it's a a little bit technical but um the way the just a very
18:58
quick give you an overview um the way we have a damic pricing mechanism on chain
19:04
and um the way that kind of the way that works at the moment is um when the the
19:09
stakers are the ones that or the pool managers they're the ones that set the price for a particular um risk
19:15
there um but when someone buys a cover um the actual cover that you the actual
19:21
price that you can buy I'm so for the next cover it shoots
19:27
up and that's kind of a like auction process continuous
19:34
auction process it's like a reverse reverse auction um and then when so the price
19:40
slowly comes down to the minimum price again and when someone buys a cover it ratchets back up and then comes back
19:45
down this proposal um is to the
19:52
price per day or the price Decay um and at the 5% um which has turned out to be um
20:01
quite slow um especially when you've got um a higher Demand on on on covers as
20:07
we've seen recently and and it's meant that there have been a few instanes that um prospective cover buyers about to
20:14
wait um material periods of time like up to a week um before they can buy cover
20:19
at a price that they're happy with and also the people on the other side the stakers being happy to sell at a lower price but um but but the system not
20:26
being able to clear them so I think it makes s to increase the the speed um and I'm proposing to increase it from half a
20:31
perc a day to 2% um a day this is kind of I think better aligns with the um I
20:37
guess the speed of which things are moving um in a bull market compared to a bare market so um hopefully we can um we
20:45
can get that updated on chain and it'll improve the ux of the cover buys um but also we'll see how it goes in terms of
20:51
um actual experience to see if it needs changing um again if it's too fast or maybe it needs to be un pushed a bit
20:56
faster who knows um so yeah it's always good to um experiment with these things um the the current parameter has been
21:02
there since we launched B2 about a year ago so um it hasn't been updated um since then um yeah so have a look um at
21:09
that if you want to get into a bit more of the technical detail um yeah that's I guess that's the main
21:16
stuff for me um obviously happy to take um questions on any of that if you
21:25
have't thanks you um if you're interested definitely check out the
21:31
discussion on forum. Nexus mutual. you will find the npip 213 proposal that H
21:39
just mentioned in detail and I'm personally looking forward to this vote which will happen um from 12 march to
21:47
14th March and um it's going to make it much easier for me to purchase cover in
Last Week in Numbers
21:53
this market so um yeah definitely check it out right now I want to briefly recap
22:00
the last week in review talk about what people purchased cover for um these lists are one of my favorite things uh I
22:08
really like to see the cover purchases of the last week it kind of shows the market sentiment and also shows what
22:16
more responsible um Deens or people in defi like to do and that's also
22:22
something that I'm quite interested in learning um without further Ado the last week of February that started uh on the
22:30
26th of February we sold about um $1 million of cover uh with that we ended
22:37
February with more than $25 million of cover and in the last week members
22:43
earned more than $75,000 in fees and the largest cover buys were for spark and
22:50
like Brave mentioned earlier Pendle has been on the list for some time so we saw
22:55
a lot of aot a lot of cover by for Pendle as well if you want to check out the full report uh please again visit
23:03
our Forum at forum. Nexus mutual. you can check out all all the other weeks analysis on there as well uh
23:12
before closing this call I want to hand things back to Lee and um Lee will talk
23:17
about the recent opening uh the Dune wizard rall which we also have posted on
23:22
the Forum I'm one of the latest additions to the DA and it's been a thrill working with the team who is
23:28
uh really value oriented and um is redefining the future of risk sharing so
23:34
please uh Brave take it away and uh talk us through the recent opening I'm sure people will would like to share it with
Open Position: Dune Wizard
23:41
their Network yeah um I wanted to share a little bit about the Dune wizard opening
23:47
within the Dow um Ry who is the head of the R&D team within the Dow posted a an
23:55
open position for a dune wizard the Dune wizard that we've been working with for a while has um just had an increased
24:02
workload uh in their existing job and they've kind of had to transition out of their role as a dune wizard working for
24:09
the Dow so we're looking for another contributor to help us out managing our Dune dashboards and creating some new
24:16
Dune dashboards as well um this position again is going to be working within the
24:21
Dow for the R&D team um on the Forum Ry has outlined the role talk about
24:27
responsib ities the uh you know the the expected hours worked and um you know
24:34
the pay rate is competitive um which is you know correlated to experience um but we put
24:40
this up last week and talking to Ry he said that we've gotten a lot of inbound
24:45
uh from this just from posting it on the jobs Channel and farcaster sharing it on Twitter and sharing within our Network
24:52
and then posting this on the governance Forum there's been a lot a lot of interest in raise there's been a lot of
24:58
talented Dune Wizards that have applied um if you know anybody who is a talented
25:03
Dune wizard who is looking for an open role to contribute to a dow um go ahead and share this with them I know Ry is
25:08
going to be doing interviews over the next couple of weeks uh he Ry estimates that we'll have somebody for this
25:14
position by the end of March um but yeah the R&D team has built the existing Dune
25:20
dashboards that we have um if you're interested in you know learning about
25:25
the covers that we're selling what covers are active you know what we're earning in cover fees split down between
25:31
eth and die uh what the mutual currently has exposure to for you know protocol
25:37
cover products or other cover products uh all of that is cataloged in detail on
25:42
our Dune dashboard so we have a dune dashboard for um Nexus Mutual covers for
25:47
the capital pool the Assets in the capital pool um ownership within the mutual we have one for the ratcheting
25:54
amm which launched in November um we've got one one for the claims history for
25:59
the mutual so you can go in and see historical outcomes and claims and there's one for uh nxm staking so you
26:06
can see what people are staking and what the different staking pools um are
26:12
staking against and kind of what the performances over time in terms of nxm rewards earned and distributed so
26:18
there's a lot of information there there's still a lot more that we'd like to build um within you know the Dune
26:25
within our Dune dashboards and adding some new Dune dashboards so having somebody who knows their way
26:30
around um doing spells that can kind of optimize their existing queries and can help us build some new dashboards to
26:37
kind of increase transparency and make information more accessible to people within the mutual and people who are
26:43
interested in learning more about the mutual so um I'm definitely looking forward to Bringing out another um Dune
26:48
wizard to help uh build up these dashboards because I use them every day I find them to be incredibly helpful um
26:55
Dune dashboards are like you know Dune is my go-to place to look up any metric within defi so whenever that's available
27:02
I think it's highly valuable so um again if you know anybody uh that would like to contribute as a dune wizard uh feel
27:08
free to share this job opening with them I will say on the Dow side that there'll be a few more openings that will be
27:13
sharing in the coming months so keep an eye on the Forum and um you know hop on
27:19
the next Community call we should have some updates to share there uh but otherwise just keep an eye on our Twitter and the governance Forum that's
27:26
where we'll be posting any opening for the Dow teams but yeah so that is my
27:32
recap on the Dune wizard role but again you can find that posting on the Forum
Open Forum
27:37
under the Dow team updates
27:42
category thank you Brave before we wrap up the call today I
27:47
want to ask uh if you guys want to bring up anything um anything else that we'd
27:52
like to touch upon um Hugh Brave and all the other listeners if you have any other
27:59
questions or um topics that you want to raise please do so now yeah I I just wanted to ask I know
28:06
we just have a few people on the call right now but um I know JT and uh jar um
28:12
and I know I've uh crossed paths with uh Tomi before in the pth in the past but I
28:20
just wanted to know um you know where are you guys depositing funds in defi or what do you find interesting in defi
28:26
right now if you'd like to raise your hand um and
28:33
come up and and chat with us that would be great but I always love hearing what other people are doing in
28:53
D5 no takers
29:04
maybe next time um yeah it's been an exciting couple of
29:10
weeks and I'm also looking forward to oh I see tomoki has raised their hand I
29:16
think we have to accept it here from the main account oh please go ahead he's up here hey how's it
29:23
going hey I'm on uh I'm on my computer I'm don't usually do T spes on my computer so I hope it
29:29
works it's working yeah uh I was kind of half listening but I think what you were
29:35
asking was uh if I had any like defi what what kind of defi positions I was in in in terms of like Nexus
29:42
Mutual uh I think just you know what do you what do you find interesting in defi right now what are you doing in defi it
29:48
doesn't have to be related to Nexus Mutual it could just be kind of anything I'm always curious to hear what people are doing in
29:55
D5 yeah uh definitely less def5 for me in terms of like dun stuff uh not not as
30:01
much as like uh defi summer uh certainly uh so maybe I'm not the right
30:08
good person to ask but like I'm in like doing igen layer things uh re liquid reaking
30:14
tokens uh simple things like that I mean definitely not simple
30:20
technically but yeah um yeah I well I don't know I
30:26
think the the dgen route is one that uh I feel that has to be your full-time job
30:33
if you're going the dgen route because it's so timec consuming um to find all of those farms and then do all those
30:39
things then again like there's a high a high degree of risk if you're actually an onchain D gen I feel like we use that
30:45
term pretty casually but I feel like degens are completely numb to any kind of like loss or feeling yeah um but igen
30:52
layer um I think is really interesting I've done some research into Igan layer
30:58
I think well it hasn't really gone live yet right it's still kind of in this like um pre-launch phase so they're just
31:05
kind of onboarding capital and I mean they've sucked up I think it's over like10 billion doar um in ether I'm sure
31:10
it's more now but it's been an incredible amount of eat that they've kind of sucked up um that's going to be
31:17
validating these different Services once they go live so it'll be really interesting um any thoughts on on risk
31:24
within igen layer um or you know what you think is gonna happen after Igan ler
31:30
launches man you know I think uh tvl is gonna take a hit because I think everyone's obviously excited about the
31:36
points uh so it's going to be interesting to see how it kind of levels out after after the couple weeks after
31:42
it launches because uh that apy is going to kind of settle down and we'll see like where the actual risk adjusted
31:49
yield ends up uh so it'll be definitely uh definitely
31:56
interesting yeah I think it will too I've been I've shared this with a lot of people that I
32:02
know in defi but I find it really interesting that there's all these things built on top already like you know each of five makes sense to me
32:08
because it's liquid staking and then they just natively restake so that model makes sense but the things like the kelp
32:15
Dow and Renzo and puffery are built on top but they're just kind of like this
32:21
added layer on top that's also using points on board more Capital so because there isn't any yield um it's just been
32:28
interesting for me that those things have launched on top already when there is an actually like a working product so it's been that to me is kind of been
32:35
fascinating the the points uh Bonanza has been I just really entertaining to watch
32:41
but it's also given product Market fit to things like pendall and everything right so it's been kind of fascinating
32:47
to see how people have speculated on points and it finally gave some of these Primitives that been around for a few
32:52
years um like a really great use case
33:00
yeah so yeah and I know GT had just messaged me
33:07
um on desktop yeah um D how did you get audio to work on desktop I I always do
33:13
it on mobile because I can never get it to work on desktop I don't know I just click the
33:20
button uh there is definitely like a lag like I click whenever I click that microphone it like takes a couple
33:26
seconds so it's just working I
33:34
guess nice I'm impressed I always stuff those things
33:39
up I don't think I've ever seen an option to be able to speak on desktop
33:45
before so you might be in like one of those limited regions where they're testing it
33:50
out yeah I don't know I mean uh I'm H like I said I was half listening uh
33:55
prior and then I heard you say my name so I kind of like plugged in really quick and then just kind of clicked the
34:01
button and it worked yeah um yeah so JT I'm not I'm
34:08
not sure if there's a button on desktop that you can click but um if not we can figure that out for next time and uh
34:15
yeah but if not feel free to drop in Discord and stuff and chat with me about uh what you're doing in defi um I'm
34:21
always interested
34:29
