hello everybody and welcome to the Nexus Mutual Community call we hold our community calls on a bi-weekly basis and
0:13
the next one will be happening on August 13th we look forward to seeing all our
0:19
members defi enthusiasts and everybody interested in the future of risk sharing
0:25
on chain today we'll start off as always with a conversation on the state of defi
Agenda
0:32
in yields and risk and then Brave will walk us through some of the new listings
0:38
on the Nexus Mutual UI would like to call them covered Alpha opportunities we have had quite an
0:45
active um discussion seen on the next Mutual governance forum and we'll talk about some of the nmp's protocol
0:52
Improvement proposals that have passed and the nmdp which will be closing today
0:58
and we'll get the latest Foundation updates from Hugh himself we'll have some more exciting
1:06
stuff to go over before further Ado let us start with the state of defi in
1:11
yields and risk Brave take it away hey good morning everyone I'll
State of DeFi
1:18
provide a brief overview of the current market and the yield environment in defi before we get into some other next
1:25
focused updates today so since our last Community call we've seen the e ETFs launch uh inflows start to flow in and
1:33
we've seen The Wider macro environment cool off a little bit in traditional and crypto markets ETF funding rates um or
1:40
eth funding rates remain in the same range though they're slightly higher since our last call we'll have to wait
1:46
and see how sentiment changes in August as e ETF see greater inflows but that
1:52
ETF launch has put a lot more eyes on ethereum we're starting to see more conversations about defi outside of crypto Twitter and outside of you know
1:59
traditional crypto media Outlets so that's very promising but the markets
2:04
within defi have reacted somewhat to this news So based on lending rates we've seen an increase in demand for
2:11
leverage the average yield for Lending on def5 uh lending protocols has hovered
2:16
around 4.44% uh which is a slight decrease but this is according to data from defi
2:21
llama uh but lending information on vault FYI shows a nearly 4% increase with the average lending rate at
2:28
8.77% across major staple coin lending markets um and you know some minor e
2:35
lending markets as well on some of those major lending protocols so even with the wider ecosystem trending sideways
2:40
there's still great yield opportunities on chain the ethery liquid vaults have consistently provided solid yields with
2:46
the benefits of points to add to the API uh a nice feature there too is you can now buy cover for those vaults directly
2:53
in the ethery uui for all liquid vaults through their Nexus Mutual point of sale integration I've also seen some solid
3:00
yields on notional V3 as part of their arbs points campaign um there's also been some good yields on extra Aerodrome
3:07
spark pamelot pendall and B's concentrated liquidity manager in the last two weeks of course there's more
3:14
there's you know more yield opportunities but those are just some of the ones that I've noticed as far as risk goes I think the
3:20
big discussion point this week was the potential compound governance attack so
3:25
somebody had put up a proposal directly on chain they didn't go through some of the standard um Forum procedures for
3:31
putting a proposal up for discussion um so they put that proposal directly on Shan that was prop 289 in compound
3:38
governance they requested 449,000 compound tokens um and this was
3:44
approved due to low return out within the compound ecosystem so if this would
3:49
have went through all the way and it would have been executed this would have given the proposer uh nearly 672 th000
3:56
in comp to vote with that would have given them enough power to far outweigh
4:01
other onchain voters in the comp ecosystem um some of the larger delegates have not been as active this
4:07
year as they have in the past so with that much voting power it would have been a pretty significant threat to
4:13
compound security but fortunately the proposer um who's part of The Golden
4:18
Boys as Dave outlined at The Forum um the leader of this outfit is his name is
4:24
Humpty and he's a large whale that's active in different defi governance ecosystems um Humpty leveraged this
4:30
proposal to get a commitment from the compound team to direct some of compound's Revenue to comp holders uh
4:38
that was discussed on the Forum yesterday he basically gave an ultimatum that um you know prop 289 would go
4:44
through unless they agreed to to these terms so an agreement was reached and um just about at the last minute prop 289
4:50
was cancelled so that 449k comp uh was not Meed and was not sent to the
4:56
proposer but governance attacks have been some thing that we've seen an increase in in the last couple of years
5:03
um you know some of the other ones that we can think about are beanock audius um beanock I think is the largest
5:09
governance attack that we've seen that costs users quite a bit of money I believe it was 181 million in losses
5:15
some of it was returned uh but ultimately the attacker capped about 76 million so this has cost users a pretty
5:22
significant amount of funds after attackers submitted malicious proposals and transferred ownership of you know
5:28
these two protocols contracts themselves so they could steal funds with defi uh
5:35
tokens you know with some like comp and some of these other um Blue Chip tokens that have been around for a while with
5:40
them being lower the cost to attack governance has gotten lower as well so if there's inactivity in a low cost then
5:47
you know the chance for an attack is on the higher side I think as omire from chaos Labs have pointed out if it's
5:56
cheap enough to execute an attack where there can be value that can be exploited from uh protocol's governance system
6:02
then at some point somebody will do it I think one notable thing is when we launch protocol cover in 2021 we did
6:08
include losses due to governance attacks this is something that at Nexus we've been talking about for several years so
6:15
you know people have discounted this risk in the past and it's not very likely but we're seeing you know more instances of this or precursors to
6:22
governance attack showing up so it's something that we've been looking for when listing new protocols for years that's why it's really important for
6:28
users to do d Ence when they're allocating in defi it's also a good reminder that buying protocol cover is
6:33
always a safe bet against some of those uncertain risks in defi um but yeah otherwise I think the
6:39
other safety uh events that have happened so security events have been compromised Discord servers compromised
6:45
front ends um I think for those there's a lot of tooling out there like wallet guard you know some of the features that
6:51
you can get in metamask you know metamask snaps where you can kind of detect some of these malicious
6:56
transactions ahead of time I know a lot of people use rabby wallet to detect some of these threat factors as well so
7:02
if you're connecting to a site that you're used to connecting to and it looks like there's a malicious proposal some of the these tooling that you can
7:08
add onto your wallets or included natively in wallets like Rabbi can alert you that you know don't sign this
7:14
transaction this looks like a malicious transaction um so be on the lookout for that as well I know there's been some
7:20
other protocols affected by this the Squarespace um breach that happened you know in previous weeks was
7:28
uh you you know was was a big cause of a lot of these but always keep your eyes out and uh always be on the lookout for
7:34
for some of these things and check out some of that tooling but with that I'll jump into a review of the new listings
New Listings
7:40
that we've added since our last Community call so since the last call we've added several new listings you can
7:45
find in the Nexus Mutual UI and on open cover we've added credit Guild which is a Oracle free lending protocol that is
7:51
on arbitrum and will soon be launching on Base reserve which is a um stable
7:57
coin index protocol that is built on quite a few networks but I think it's the largest on base at the moment and
8:04
contango which is a leverage protocol that's built on top of a lot of existing D5 protocols like Pendle Silo av3
8:13
compound morpo a lot of other protocols but a lot of people have been using this for leverage strategies where they can
8:19
Farm points and earn yield um through looping strategies so we have some of
8:25
those I believe we'll have some more coming but since we've listed a lot of protocols here in the last several
8:30
months I think we'll be seeing uh fewer listings unless there's you know a glut of more protocols that are launching but
8:37
as always if you have a listing that you'd like to see that isn't currently in the Nexus Mutual UI just ask us to
8:43
review a potential new listing you can send me a DM on X reach out to me in the Nexus Mutual Discord or send us a
8:49
message through the contact form on the Nexus Mutual website so going through some governance
Governance Updates
8:55
updates in the last couple of weeks we've seen three uh nmps put on chain for voting and we've had one nmdp open
9:02
for voting I'll provide a brief summary of these vote outcomes for everyone in the call so the Nexus Mutual protocol
9:10
Improvement proposal 225 which is the divestment framework this was put forward by the investment committee they
9:16
proposed establishing an investment framework to create Capital targets for eth and stable coin assets held in the
9:22
capital pool the framework outlined in this proposal will be used to ensure there's always enough eth and stable
9:27
coin assets heeld the capital pool to honor future ratcheting amm or Ram redemptions and ensure that all Claims
9:34
can be paid if there's a loss of that in claim troll in in the future the targets outlined in NM pip 225 are 1 million in
9:42
stable coins and 12,500 e that are to be held in the capital pool so uh with those targets
9:51
that uh this gu investment framework outlines selling some of our productive assets like steth and reth to lessen our
9:59
exposure me as more eth is redeemed we're getting Overexposed to some of those assets so swapping out of some of
10:05
those things to make sure that we have enough eth in the capital pool and making sure we have enough stable coins
10:11
as well but this vot closed on the 14th of July and members voted to approve
10:16
this proposal you can see that outcome in the governance Tab and the Nexus mol UI for nmip 227 this is the av3 loan
10:25
repayment and liquidation policy this is another strategy that the investment committee proposed for repaying the
10:31
covery Associated Al loan and increasing collateral to avoid Liquidation in the event that the price of e drops in the
10:37
future so the proposed actions include repaying parts of the loan using excess stable coins in the capital pool that
10:44
rise above that $ million threshold for stable coins Additionally the um eth
10:50
collateral that's on AV V3 will be topped up with an additional 3,000 eth
10:56
at specific ethusd price threshold so $1,600 12250 and a, if he drops down to
11:02
those levels We'll add more collateral uh according to this framework to make sure that the loan that's on a does not
11:10
get liquidated and then there's a provision in there to make an emergency repayment if the eusd price drops below
11:17
$500 at the discretion of The Advisory board so this framework pretty much outlines ways to pay off that loan and
11:24
then what to do when to add collateral if the price of e drops you can see those full details on the Forum and you
11:32
can check out the governance tab at the Nexus Mutual UI but this vote closed on the 21st of July with members voting to
11:38
approve this proposal n mpip 228 which is the investment uh proposal that's been
11:45
discussed for the last month um this was to allocate 6575 eth chorus one in ethery so the
11:52
investment committee has worked with avangard and ethery to discuss potential allocation strategies for the
12:00
6575 eth that was available in the Nexus Mutual enzyme Vault these assets were
12:05
idle um and so these discussions were around allocating this Capital to other productive strategies through that
12:11
enzyme bolt uh we took a snapshot votes and got sentiment feedback from members
12:16
on how much they wanted to allocate to each strategy so the proposal was about allocating 4,989 each to corus 1 via a stake wise
12:25
V3 pool and 1,586 E to Ether by acquiring rapti eth
12:31
through enzyme so the investment Community used the results of that signaling vote to create the uh proposal
12:38
so nmp i228 this was put on chain and voted on by members members voted to approve this
12:44
after this vote closed on the 21st of July and at this time I believe the avantgard team is in the process of
12:51
executing that investment strategy you can stay up to date on that by checking in the Nexus Mutual enzyme bolt UI um
12:58
and you can see the results of that votes in the Nexus Mutual governance uh
13:03
tab in the UI as well and then the last update I have is on the Nexus Mutual Dow
13:08
proposal so nmdp 7 this was the proposal for funding the Dow teams for the next
13:14
12 months the Dow teams requested 76,500 usdc and
13:20
2,464 wxm to fund the next 12 months of operations the Dow teams currently
13:25
consist of the community research and development investment Market and product and risk teams each team has
13:32
highlighted their purpose past performance and upcoming priorities in this nmdp and that has all been
13:37
available on the Forum this discussion's been going on for a little bit more than a month this proposal was open for
13:43
review from the 25th of July until the 30th of July so that closed earlier this morning and members voted to approve
13:49
this proposal with a 115k nxm voting to approve and there were no other votes to
13:56
abstain or to not approve on this so that funding will be doled out in
14:01
quarterly allocations to um to meet liabilities for paying out full-time and
14:09
part-time team member salaries for you know some um marketing strategies and
14:14
everything all of the detail of the Dow teams funding is on the Forum there's
14:20
quite a bit of detail in there uh but I'm happy to take any questions on any of these governance proposals if anybody
14:26
has any before I move on
Updates From The Foundation
14:39
okay if nobody has any comments then I will hand things off to Hugh so he can
14:44
give his foundation updates H hey everyone um yes few things going
14:51
on at the foundation um thanks Braven and Sam so uh couple yeah a couple items
14:58
I just run through them um we've dialectic fund portfolio cover every news this week so we went launched this
15:04
about a month ago now um and we're also getting some decent inbound like from
15:09
other funds that are potentially interested in this so it's um so it's quite quite interesting and and we're going to be pushing a bit heavier on the
15:15
marketing side yet we haven't really announced it yet so um that that's that's exciting um we think there
15:20
there's a pretty solid product here um especially for those fund and defi like power users and stuff so um we're
15:27
getting some good feedback on it so far so hope that continues um I guess still on the product side a few few more items
15:33
so open covers transaction cover um which really released about a month ago
15:39
as well now um we've got had another partner go go live um which is exciting so um the both of these are a bit below
15:47
the radar and kind of just on trial St um stages at the moment as they look to just um test things out cuz it's a new
15:53
product and a few things going on um but really excited about this because I think it's one of those things that um
15:58
people really want um protection on so you know it's it's basically if you make a transaction and something goes wrong
16:05
with that transaction you interact with a um scam protocol or something like
16:10
that so um so it's interesting um as a as a product and um it kind of excited
16:15
to see grow um on the on I guess on the product side as well we've got we're working on
16:21
a new product specifically for L2 users um that we're kind of just sketching out um at the moment um and I believe
16:28
there's going to be some newsletter is going to contain um some feedback for people to um to give us so help us shape
16:35
it um and get the get the final details right so if you if you're interested in that um try to make it really easy for
16:41
for lat to users to get some coverage so um check out our newsletter and give some feedback if you if you have the
16:46
time that would be great um I guess a few other bits and pieces um the Define
16:53
Lama tvl is now actually updated correctly they they were kind of reading for my contracts directly but then we
16:59
did updates they didn't follow automatically we didn't kind of pick that up but but now they're reading it onchain directly and it'll and it'll be
17:05
more robust as it'll follow automatically follow the onchain updates whenever they happen um so that's really
17:11
good um so I think the D Lama tvl gets distributed to co Geo and and other places as well so it's a it's good to
17:18
get that um working correctly um the I guess another piece which we have been
17:24
working on for quite a while now but we've got an exciting partnership on the district distribution side that we've
17:29
yet to be announced so we'll have official announcements in the coming months on this but I think it's really
17:34
exciting it's a um it's something that I think will set us up very well for like the longer term um and building out um
17:41
Sol distribution into the more traditional um Insurance space so um so really excited about that and um we'll
17:48
be be able to hear more about it um when we when we can um finally announce it properly and I guess the other other
17:55
more I guess technical update um we have we have um performed a few smart
18:02
contract upgrades on chain so you will be able to see those um on the on the governance um tab um so
18:10
governance contract governance um proposals 230 and 231 um they they're
18:15
basically they're non-functional changes um they're basically splitting up one of the contracts into two separate
18:22
contracts um so that there's room because we're hitting the size limit um technical size limit on ethereum um per
18:28
contract and so we wanted to make sure that um if we had to emergency fix bugs we actually have room in the contracts
18:34
to do this um so it it's a bit more of a um preventative and future um
18:40
functionality um piece CU we've we've got some planned upgrades around um
18:46
cover edits and and a few other different bits and pieces that we'll need to increase the size of the contracts this is kind of a just a um
18:52
nonfunctional upgrade but just so you're aware and you know what um what's going on there but um I think think more
18:59
generally on the um on the dev side in terms of features um we're looking at um
19:05
the two big features sets that we're looking at at the moment are the cover edits which has been challenging because of the technical complexities of what we
19:11
want to do and and things we've had a few goes at different structures um but we've now settled on one that that's
19:17
looking quite good and and so we're working on that and the other um I guess
19:23
a big functional one that we're just kicking off at the moment um is limit orders so we're looking to to um work
19:29
out how you can basically intents or limit orders whatever you want to call them different people have different names um but you would be able to like
19:36
say um I'll buy um 100,000 of cover at this price and then the stakers can come
19:42
in and provide that capacity and it can get executed so um you can kind of do do it um in advance um so that's that's
19:50
quite interesting because it also opens up some other different functionality more broadly from a ux point of view which is quite cool um so those are the
19:57
kind of main things on the on the side apart from the um the UI which we're releasing UI um new UI um stage by stage
20:05
so the the new membership flow um it's just been released this morning um which is which is pretty cool so um you'll be
20:12
able to and we're working on the the claims and the staking um next so um you'll see the bik up has already been
20:18
live so you'll see the um new changes come out over the over the coming months as we as we get through them but it's
20:23
yeah nice to see all the the new UI come come through CU um it looks a lot better and it's a lot easier to use I'm looking
20:29
forward to the staking one in particular um I think that's it I know I've whipped
20:35
through a whole lot um pretty quickly so I'm happy to take questions if you have
Team Roadmap
20:43
them all right thanks you um I will jump in and talk through some of the team
20:49
road map highlights so just after our last Community call the Dow Community team posted the Q3 and Q4 team road map
20:58
which provides an overview of what the foundation and DOW teams are prioritizing over the next 6 months
21:03
we've recap our core objectives progress to date and planned initiatives the down found Foundation teams are really
21:09
committed to transparency and so we share our latest goals and efforts on the Forum on a six-month basis looking
21:17
at our core objectives they remain unchanged we're still laser focused on growth looking at um growing cover sales
21:23
through new product launches developing new products that can help us scale cover growth as well and generate more
21:29
premiums for the capital pool the R&D team is working on the last phase of the
21:35
tokenomics project which is our second priority um this project is focused on how the MCR Works in low Capital
21:41
situations they'll be working on that in Q3 and Q4 and we're working on a wider
21:46
research project for governance which the R&D and Community teams are leading the first phase of after that the
21:52
engineering team will take over and research the application implementation requirements um that third priority is
21:59
Progressive decentralization to get more people involved within the mutual and the governance decisions that dictate
22:06
the future direction that the mutual goes in so we're working on a system that's more inclusive and one that is
22:12
easier for people to participate in and stay more involved in within the mutual
22:18
so those core objectives remain unchanged you can find those on the forum for the teams they've all provided
22:23
updates as well and I'll share some highlights from each of the major teams
22:28
on the Foundation Engineering team I think Hugh shared some of these but they're going to be focusing on the user
22:34
interface and user experience improvements so like you said we've already seen a few go live the
22:39
membership flow I Believe has just gone live or will be going live very soon so
22:45
when people sign up there'll be a different flow the goal is to reduce friction and make it as easy as possible
22:50
for people to on board to the mutual um there are going to be some other improvements like the main dashboard
22:56
that you see in the NEX mut UI right now it's just say uh membership
23:02
but we're going to kind of reconfigure that UI so it's easier for you to keep track of all of your deposits within the
23:07
protocol and stay up to date on everything you're doing within the mutual and then learning about different ways you can get involved as well so
23:14
kind of making that dashboard an allinone place for you to look at your participation within the mutual uh the
23:21
engineering team is going to be working with uh ultim Design Studio which we've been working with on the previous uh
23:27
improvements to the UI but the next flows that we're going to be working on are the staking and claims UI um we're going to be overhauling both
23:34
of those so look out for updates on those later in Q3 or Q4 and then um any
23:41
remaining user flows are going to be tackled after we get through the saking and claims uh flows as
23:46
well um the engineering team is also going to be working on limit orders I think you um cover this but just having
23:53
a better function for uh matching supply and demand so if people want to request capacity they don't have to do it to the
23:59
contact form they can do it right on Shain and then Stak and pool operators or St and pool managers can see that and
24:05
decide which limit orders they want to fill to make it more of a seamless process for people that want to buy
24:11
cover or people that want to supply capacity where it's not currently available and then the engineering team
24:16
is going to be launching the cover in its feature we've talked about this there have been some delays but um this
24:22
should be coming we've got an engineer that's dedicated to this and um this should facilitate easier renewals people
24:28
without the need to Mint a new nft uh this will be really helpful for our distribution Partners uh there are more
24:35
updates for from the engineering team but just want to give you a highlight on the top three priorities for these teams
24:41
for the foundation business and development team they are going to be focusing on driving point of sale
24:46
Integrations we've already seen Integrations in the ethery liquid vaults
24:51
um and ethery UI which has been great but they're working on developing some standardized requirements for the
24:57
purchasing experience in other uis they're talking to different protocols to get more point of sale Integrations
25:02
to help us build out our distribution um Network within defi so
25:07
just to make it as easy as POS possible for people to buy cover um they're going to be working on more white glove and
25:13
bespoke solutions for uh different audiences that are coming to the mutual a lot of higher Network individuals or
25:20
funds working on more solutions for them to make it easier for them to purchase cover to the mutual and get faster
25:27
service so that the they keep coming back and keep buying coverage and then the BD team is also going to be managing
25:32
the grants and accelerator program um Dopey is kind of leading the efforts here but the efforts launch on like a
25:39
big public launch the program conducting Outreach which is already something they've been working on and then aiming
25:44
to onboard one Syndicate and fund six grants that will contribute to the nextal ecosystem on the product and risk
25:51
side um we're going to be entering R&D on a new bundle type product that's designed to provide cover across
25:57
multiple protocols I believe you talked a little bit about this as well but given the success we've seen with bundle protocol cover we've
26:03
been playing around with an idea for a different product that has kind of all-in-one coverage for certain nonchain
26:10
ecosystems so um I'll talk about this uh after I go through this highlight as well because we currently have a survey
26:16
that I would really love for people to fill out and provide some feedback on but the goal is to develop and finalize
26:21
this product and then launch this sometime in Q3 or Q4 we're also going to be working to support new and existing
26:27
syndicates on new product development um you know some of the examples we've seen are the retail Mutual um Sherlock some
26:36
people that are building on top of us that want uh to launch new cover products and then distribute those cover
26:41
products we're going to be working with more syndicates and more syndicates are coming on chain as well um to build out
26:46
products and kind of expand distribution and of course increase sales and then I'm going to be heading up a bridge
26:52
research uh project for bridge risk we've seen a lot of requests for bridge cover um but it isn't a product that we
26:58
currently offer I'm going to do a deep dive on bridge infrastructure and risk
27:04
create a risk framework for this and then we can create a pricing model for this risk and work on some cover wording so we can launch a bridge cover product
27:11
in the future on the R&D side they're going to be focused on the product and protocol so they're going to provide
27:17
input on pricing for new products using their actu Actuarial experience they're
27:22
going to support on design and sessing out edge cases for new technical projects
27:28
and then they're going to help on the business side design and uh on engineering heavy projects where they
27:34
can provide some help uh on lift for the engineering team on the D analytics side
27:39
we've got Tomas who's a really great Dune wizard um he's going to help us create some new dashboards we've already
27:45
launched uh a couple or overhauled some that we have you can see those in the Nexus Mutual June dashboard um overview
27:53
you can see all the dashboards we have uh the the BD dashboard that he recently launched is really great so he's going
27:58
to maintain those dashboards keep them up to date uh if there's any protocol changes and then build out some more to
28:04
support some people in our ecosystem and of course the R&D team is going to work on that MCR calculation project that I
28:09
talked about on the Dow Community team side uh Dow Community team is going to be focused on creating new guides for
28:15
members and staking pool managers so as the UI is changed um we want to make sure that we're providing updated
28:22
resource updated resources like video guides and written resources to assist people that are buying cover or
28:28
launching or managing staking pools people that need to file claims pretty much going through all of the flows and
28:34
making some guides so it's as easy as possible to understand how the mutual works and how to contribute in these core functions um the Dow Community team
28:41
is also going to work on designing an onboarding program we know that it can be kind of intimidating to onboard to
28:47
the mutual and kind of get accustomed to all of the different flows and all of the different roles that you can perform within the mutual so the community team
28:54
is going to design an onboarding program so new people can come into Discord or they can sign up through other means and
29:00
they can basically jump on a call on a bi-weekly Cadence something along those lines and kind of cover the basics about
29:06
the mutual and ask questions so we can support more people getting involved in the ecosystem and then the Dow Community
29:12
team is going to continue the covering T interview series on Twitter spaces so uh
29:18
look for more updates about that of course there's a lot more included in the latest road map um I'm sure nobody
29:23
wants to hear me run through the entire thing but you can find that road map on the Nexus Mutual governance Forum or you
29:29
can wait for a special issue of the Hedge that's going to recap a lot of this road map as well um in the Hedge if
29:36
you're not aware is the mutuals community newsletter that goes out on a monthly basis this special issue is
29:42
going to be um in between our our two monthly issues that'll be coming out the next couple of weeks so look for
29:47
announcements from the Nexus Mutual Twitter um Nexus Mutual Discord and Nexus Mutual telegram channels as well
29:54
as on LinkedIn um any questions on the team roadmap before I move
30:05
on okay if not I want to talk a bit about a new product that we're developing on the product in Risk
DeFi Pass Survey
30:11
team so we've been developing this new product like I had talked about and we're looking for your feedback so if
30:17
you're a def user of any experience level we would really like to hear from you especially if you use protocols on
30:23
bass arbitrum Optimum uh optimism and other layer twos this new survey only
30:28
takes a few minutes and your input is really really valuable so I hope that you can fill out the survey and help us
30:33
bring this new flexible cover product to market the idea behind this is that we take the best parts of bundle protocol
30:39
cover and make them a little bit more flexible so that you can deposit into different protocols um and you can have a choice
30:46
of let's say like the top five protocols for a given ecosystem um you would have
30:52
this coverage where you could move funds around and you would still have coverage so um I've got some details in that
30:58
survey if you want to check that out and fill that out you can also find that survey in the latest issue of the Hedge and we'll we've dropped it in threads
31:04
for today's call as well you can find that in the thread for today's call I've linked to that tweet um I've also put
31:11
out a message on our Discord our LinkedIn um and soon I'll put one out on telegram so uh if anybody wants to fill
31:18
out that survey and provide us with feedback I would really really appreciate it with that I am going to hand things
31:24
