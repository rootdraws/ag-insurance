Intro
0:11
so
0:12
now let's dive a little bit deeper give
0:13
you a little bit of teaser
0:15
of what to expect when we talk about the
0:16
economics of nexus mutual
0:18
so on a very high level summary what is
0:20
nexus mutual nexus mutual is
0:23
a decentralized insurance protocol that
0:25
is on the ethereum platform
0:27
and they what they do is they pull the
0:29
different assets together
0:32
to as you can as you can imagine you
0:34
have your die you have your ether
0:36
you pull them together to be and it's
0:39
governed by all the different
0:40
the three types of users you have the
0:42
cover buyers
0:43
you have the assets assessor and you
0:45
have the claims assessor
0:46
so it's governed and created for these
0:48
users and really managed by the users
0:52
so the coverage is really just the smart
0:54
contract coverage which is
0:56
the internal technical risks that will
0:58
be the code
1:00
there will be smart contract hacks
1:01
there'll be smart contract exploits
1:02
there'll be
1:03
your different bugs in the code so for
1:05
example a payout was
1:06
in the b the bzx the bzx
1:10
exploit that happened a couple months
1:12
ago
1:13
where someone could exploit the code in
1:18
the code in the smart contract and
1:21
the risk assessor said yes you could pay
1:24
out
1:25
or yes this is a risk and this is a bug
1:28
and this is a smart contract problem
1:30
yes whoever that buys the risk can get a
1:32
payout and
1:33
people do get a payout
Access to NXM
1:37
how do you get access to nxm this is a
1:39
very interesting
1:41
model then because nxm decides to go
1:44
on the regulated way so they're a uk
1:47
registered mutual company
1:49
and so for anyone to be able to get the
1:51
nxm token
1:52
you have to be kyc'd so that means you
1:55
know you have to send your your passport
1:57
information you have to send your photo
1:58
and everything
2:00
once once that's done you have to pay a
2:02
small amount of membership i think it's
2:03
like 0.002 or 3 eth
2:06
and you pay for the membership and now
2:08
you are part of a company like you are
2:10
part of a uk registered company for real
2:13
and that's why kyc is so important and
2:16
because you're now part of the company
2:18
now part of a uk registered company
2:20
you're part of the board of directors
2:22
you can get access to the nxm token so
2:25
you can get
2:25
access to the platform in two ways the
2:27
first one is to buy coverage
2:29
so you can get a quote in seconds you
2:31
just have to put you know what kind of
2:32
protocols you want to cover
2:33
how much money you want or how much
2:35
assets you wanna cover for
2:37
and duration of coverage so and then you
2:40
get a quote in seconds
2:41
so that's done and it's coverage you can
2:44
also get access to the nxm platform by
2:47
purchasing the token itself
2:48
you can purchase it on the token on the
2:51
platform
2:52
and this is defined by a bonding curve
2:54
you thought they've been done with
2:55
bonding cups right
2:56
once moved to insurance no i think
2:59
bonding cups is going to follow us for a
3:00
very long time
3:01
i'm definitely going to talk about
3:02
bonding cups in the next episode
3:05
so in this in the nxm model they use
3:07
bonding costs in a different way
3:09
and the bonding curve is you purchase
3:11
bonding conveyor the platform
3:13
and the bonding curve will will define
3:16
quite a lot of interesting dynamics it's
3:17
very wonderful i will talk about it in
3:19
the next episode
3:21
you can so you can only buy nxm token if
3:23
you're kyc
3:24
by them however i'm sure you've heard of
3:27
this thing called
3:28
um wnxm
3:31
right so there's a rep nxm that is
3:33
tradable on
3:35
secondary markets nxm itself is not
3:37
tradable however
3:38
rep nxm is tradable on secondary market
3:41
like uni swap
3:42
so this uni swap is able to unisop
3:46
in unison you can trade like ether for
3:49
for
3:50
rep and exam and you can speculate on
3:52
the price
3:53
you can only trade rep and exam for an
3:55
actual nxm
3:56
via a whole like a kyc a person who
4:00
has kyc on the platform itself to get
4:02
access to nxm
4:03
or you have to be kyc to be to be doing
4:05
that so
4:07
this is a whole new like there's a
4:10
secondary market for nxm
4:11
that it's not trading using nxm that is
4:14
also a very interesting economic model
4:15
that we will talk about
NXM Token
4:18
so what does the nxm token do then you
4:21
know
4:21
what what are the things to what is the
4:24
entire purpose of nxm token if it's not
4:26
traded in the secondary market
4:28
right because the entire purpose of the
4:30
nxm token
4:32
is to be traded in the primary internal
4:34
economy
4:35
what it does is with the bonding curve
4:37
again the bonding curve it balances the
4:39
token prices
4:40
with the collaterals that's available so
4:43
it
4:44
it changes so the nxm price is not fixed
4:47
all the time
4:47
it changes based on the amount of
4:48
collaterals over there so
4:51
based on the amount of collaterals it
4:53
can cover more or less insurance
4:56
or it can provide more or less coverage
4:58
so if there's a lot of collaterals then
4:59
you have more funds to be able to
5:01
covering
5:01
to be covering more of these d5
5:04
protocols d5 insurance
5:06
if there's less collaterals then you
5:08
just have to cover less
5:10
so if you think about it the price of
5:12
the tokens the internal price of the
5:14
token so nxm price not
5:15
rep and exam the nxm price is a signal
5:19
to the information of how much people
5:21
trust an exam and how
5:22
how much people are willing to use it
5:24
remember i told you that all the way in
5:26
the beginning
5:27
the insurance is about the economics of
5:29
signaling
5:30
this is what i'm talking about because
5:32
how do you
5:33
how do you share how do you
5:36
share the information that people are
5:37
trusting your system you can't just go
5:40
around telling people
5:41
hey buy my buy my stuff because people
5:43
trust it it's like
5:44
okay talk is cheap so what this token
5:47
does is that
5:48
it becomes a signal to tell other people
5:51
that hey my price of this token has
5:55
grown because people are believing and
5:56
trusting in my project
5:58
and my protocol so you should also trust
6:01
it because so many people are trusting
6:02
it
6:03
so this is a very interesting dynamics
6:05
that we're talking about here because we
6:07
are taking the same concept
6:08
remember in economics the foundational
6:10
concepts the foundational principles
6:12
don't change
6:13
so the economics of signaling doesn't
6:14
change but how we use economics of
6:16
signaling
6:17
in such insurance model in a new
6:19
technology technological stack
6:21
is absolutely mind-blowing right now
6:24
the token becomes a signal to how much
6:27
people trust
6:28
the system the price of the token as
6:31
well becomes a different kind of signal
6:33
to the adoption rate of d5 protocols
6:36
think about it in d5 we it's super cool
6:38
right in indie file you you've got the
6:40
total locked value you have the prices
6:42
of the tokens
6:43
you have this different matrix to
6:44
understand the
6:46
growth of d5 good stuff i like that
6:51
but to really understand how the mass
6:54
population is adopting d5
6:56
you don't look at the total locked value
6:58
because there's going to be a lot of
7:00
double counting
7:00
you look at how how risk averse people
7:03
are you look at the risk profile of
7:05
people
7:06
if more people are purchasing insurance
7:09
then you know that they are more likely
7:10
they're probably number one
7:11
probably probably making riskier
7:13
investments
7:14
so it shows that they do have some faith
7:17
in the system
7:17
but they're also a bit afraid of the
7:19
risk so they're buying insurance
7:20
or number two more people are coming
7:22
into the space
7:24
and usually these are new people in the
7:26
crypto space
7:27
so you want to be covered you want your
7:29
risk to be less
7:31
so you want insurance coverage and you
7:33
get the and you get coverage with nexus
7:35
mutual
7:36
and as more people get coverage with
7:38
nexus mutual the price of the tokens
7:40
increase
7:41
so that also means that as more people
7:43
come in more people want coverage
7:44
it means that more people are using the
7:46
d5 protocols and that's a good sign
7:48
it's a good sign because now it's a much
7:51
much
7:52
a much better matrix a much better
7:56
variable or signal to show what is the
7:59
adoption rate of d5 protocols
8:01
because in total locked value you could
8:03
have a couple of wheels make a big
8:05
purchase
8:05
purchase it there leave it there and
8:07
that's it and then wait for prices to go
8:09
arise and then
8:10
do something else but it's not real
8:12
adoption real adoption rate
8:14
we look at nexus mutual because it's
8:17
also
8:18
it's not just amount of coverage in
8:20
terms of money but also length of
8:21
coverage
8:22
so that's a very interesting matrix to
8:24
consider when you're looking at the
8:25
adoption rate of
8:27
d5 and lastly how can you use
8:30
the token as much as the token is going
8:32
to be a beautiful
8:34
you know beautiful token to talk about
8:36
signaling to talk about moral hazards to
8:38
talk about
8:39
law of large numbers at the end of the
8:41
day you need to have
8:42
actual use case of nexus mutual so we
8:45
talked about before with all the
8:46
different participants
8:47
you could use it for staking you could
8:49
use it to be buying insurance coverage
8:51
you could be using it for governance
8:53
governance kind of mechanisms
8:55
so there are real use cases for nexus
8:57
mutual tokens
8:58
and that's why it justifies the
9:01
different
9:01
value the different value according to
9:04
the bonding curve with the amount of
9:05
collaterals involved as well
9:08
so if you're interest if you're
9:10
interested we're going to talk a little
9:11
bit a little bit more about that
9:12
in the next episode but i want to kind
9:15
of wrap this up
9:16
by talking about the future development
9:18
of insurance in general
Future of Insurance
9:21
because this is not it what we're
9:23
talking about here
9:24
is just the beginning it's just the
9:26
beginning of insurance development
9:28
and development of insurance in the
9:30
crypto space and this is getting really
9:32
exciting
9:33
we're probably going to start looking at
9:35
other risks to cover
9:36
so right now we're just only looking at
9:38
internal technical risk right
9:40
your smart contract the bugs the code as
9:43
i mentioned soon we're going to start
9:44
looking at the different
9:45
external technical risks so your layer
9:48
one protocol how will it affect your
9:49
label
9:50
layer two transactions stuff like your
9:52
oracles
9:53
stuff like your governance attacks stuff
9:55
like your byzantine
9:57
attacks stuff like your civil attacks
10:00
once we can calculate these risks
10:02
once we can put the price to them we can
10:03
cover them the other stuff will be
10:06
your insurance types you know right now
10:08
we're just looking at
10:10
smart contract smart contract code
10:12
insurance
10:13
there could be a lot of other insurance
10:14
in the internal technical risk part in
10:16
the external technical risk part in the
10:18
economic incentive risk part
10:20
a lot of other insurance available then
10:22
we also
10:24
i'm pretty sure we're going to see a lot
10:25
of development in the insurance space
10:27
right now in insurance we have nexus
10:28
mutual for the for the peer-to-peer d5
10:31
space
10:32
we have ether risk for the some flight
10:35
flight insurance thing which i don't
10:37
know if it's still working because no
10:38
one's taking flights anymore
10:39
we have the ibm and ibm musk and ey kind
10:43
of collaboration
10:44
which is which is where they use
10:48
it's a it's a b to b to b kind of system
10:51
and they use
10:52
blockchain as a immutable database which
10:55
is fine
10:55
but there are a lot of other ways we
10:57
could look at
10:58
the development displays so for example
11:01
it could be using blockchain to
11:02
underwrite the different risks
11:03
with lower cost so if we start believing
11:07
that blockchain
11:08
is an immutable database we can trust
11:10
the data there
11:11
we can trust the data there we can
11:14
underwrite risks a lot faster so for
11:16
example
11:16
this shipment is going from port a to
11:18
port b we have all the different
11:20
risk timing we have the profile of the
11:22
ship we have the profile of the ports we
11:24
have the profile of the goods
11:25
then we can use smart contracts or you
11:28
know these kind of business logics
11:29
to be writing a risk print like a risk
11:32
coverage
11:34
just before the ship decides to leave
11:36
the dock so then
11:38
it's it's a lot more automated and
11:40
things could could
11:42
execute a lot faster and if there's
11:44
anything that happens we have all these
11:45
oracles that comes in all this
11:47
information that's being aggregated from
11:48
the online and offline of on-chain and
11:50
off-chain world coming together
11:52
interacting with each other and then you
11:54
can have a payout immediately so there
11:56
are a lot of
11:56
developments in this space and i'm
11:58
really really excited
Outro
12:00
what about development in the crypto
12:02
space specifically
12:04
or the d5 space because those could be
12:07
just a b to b or b to b to b or you know
12:09
in the institutional space
12:11
in the crypto p to p space i would say
12:14
right now
12:14
i know n of t is a big thing nft plus d
12:17
phi even bigger
12:19
now we put insurance in there insurance
12:21
for nfts
12:22
we talk about art pieces these are
12:24
pieces could be hacked
12:25
these art pieces could be stolen could
12:27
we have insurance for them
12:28
or could we if you think about how
12:30
insurance is being made you have all
12:31
these underlying insurance
12:33
right like aig axa aia
12:36
and they would take some of this
12:37
insurance stuff repackage it up and then
12:39
sell it to other people
12:40
so that's what i could foresee some
12:42
other people doing as well where nxm is
12:44
the
12:44
underlying layer and you have all these
12:46
other parties coming in to repackage nxm
12:49
into almost like an nft which is like a
12:52
contract like the insurance contract
12:55
that can be resold or repurchased or
12:57
purchased infractions
12:58
which is also another pretty cool thing
13:01
so think of insurance
13:02
agents as a new debt that sits on top of
13:06
nxm
13:07
that's what i mean and lastly it's
13:09
insurance reinsurance
13:10
so if you've got someone sitting on top
13:12
of nxm you could also have other people
13:14
sitting below nxm which are in
13:16
reinsurance in the space and so these
13:19
are a lot of
13:20
new interesting things that will come
13:22
and should come
13:23
very very soon once we understand a
13:25
little bit more about the risk profiles
13:26
how to price risk and all that kind of
13:28
stuff
13:29
it is really really exciting
13:32
so that's it for this episode in the
13:34
next episode i'll dive deeper into
13:36
nxm into understanding the economics
13:39
behind behind an exam the different
13:40
economic incentives in place
13:42
how the tokens work and all the other
13:44
super fun details that's going to come
13:46
if any questions of nxm put them below
13:49
so that i can address them in the next
13:51
in the next episode till then i'll see
13:54
you in the next episode
13:55
