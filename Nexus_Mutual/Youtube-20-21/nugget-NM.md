hi guys thanks for tuning in to another
0:01
episode of Nuggets news today we welcome
0:03
a special guest and that's Hugh the
0:05
founder of Nexus mutual we're gonna be
0:07
talking about financial derivatives
0:09
insurance doing this through the
0:11
decentralized model I'm really looking
0:13
forward to this I think we're gonna go
0:14
into some fascinating topic so thanks
0:16
for joining us today here yeah great to
0:18
be here thanks Alex I mean where do we
0:19
even start I've often thought that the
0:21
world of insurance is next it's a
0:24
perfect application for blockchain and
0:26
everything that's going on the d-5 space
0:27
I know you're doing a lot of interaction
0:29
there but maybe start off with a really
0:31
basic explanation of how insurance works
0:33
in the traditional world and what led
0:35
you guys to go down this path yeah yeah
0:39
it's really fascinating I mean insurance
0:41
person my background I've been doing
0:42
insurance for quite a while so I mean
0:45
stepping white right back
0:47
insurance is actually just about
0:48
financially coordinating a bunch of
0:50
people pooling money together and then
0:53
deciding in some way how to distribute a
0:57
claim payment and and really all that's
1:00
the main intention is just to me the
1:02
group of people or society more
1:04
resilient to risk so you kind of pull
1:07
the risk between a group of people and
1:10
that's that's fundamentally all it is
1:13
now we've kind of moved away from this
1:16
kind of mutual model of doing things
1:18
which is kind of how it used to start
1:20
hundreds and thousands of years ago and
1:23
we've kind of gone to they like the
1:24
shareholder model of doing stuff which
1:26
makes a lot of sense mainly because it's
1:29
kind of the most efficient way we have
1:31
right now of connecting capital to
1:34
people so you can't use the shareholders
1:36
to connect the capital - to the risk
1:38
where it's the people that need cover I
1:41
get bit at a very high level our our
1:43
premise is that we now have a pretty
1:46
cool financial coordination tool on the
1:50
blockchain on a very amande you can
1:52
actually use that to create incentives
1:54
to bring people together without the
1:56
need for that shareholder module or
1:58
shareholder insurance coming so that's
2:00
essentially what we're trying to do yeah
2:02
and I think for people at home I know
2:03
the first questions that come to mind
2:05
for me with how do we do the the
2:07
settlement and there's I guess the
2:08
dispute process and all those gray areas
2:10
in between so where do you want to start
2:12
there she
2:13
talk about Oracle's and how we get the
2:14
the real data from the real world into
2:16
the blockchain yeah so we decided pretty
2:20
early on that we wanted to have the
2:23
fancy man approaches you can have a
2:24
voting structure of some description or
2:26
a kind of Oracle driven approach we
2:29
decided pretty early on we wanted a
2:30
voting structure primarily because we
2:34
didn't want to be limited by what data
2:38
feeds we could get to therefore tell us
2:41
which con which type of covers we want
2:43
constructed and and we wanted to be a
2:47
bit more flexible than that
2:48
so we went with the voting approach
2:49
which kind of allows us to get any type
2:52
of information on it obviously has there
2:55
are pros and cons with this approach you
2:56
know it's a bit more complicated and but
2:59
there is a bit more breadth but I guess
3:01
like Timothy is like claim pouts in the
3:04
insurance world inherently gray there's
3:06
no always black and white definition
3:09
here and if you create a black and white
3:10
definition then you can end up paying
3:12
the wrong people or you can end up
3:13
paying not enough to the right people I
3:16
mean that happens with any solution so
3:18
we just want us to have a more voting
3:20
structure that could actually more like
3:24
offer any product you can put kind of a
3:26
lot of flexibility with that and so you
3:28
can actually compete with the regular
3:29
insurance companies in the world if you
3:32
have that piece and then who's voting at
3:34
this stage is this the full
3:36
decentralized model where all token
3:38
holders will have a say and if that is
3:40
the case if I'm voting on whether or not
3:43
someone with something happens in the
3:45
real world their house gets burned down
3:47
how do I know without all that knowledge
3:49
whether or not the fire was the cause
3:51
and whether to pay them out and I am
3:53
good good point I mean we've got so
3:56
basically as the members of the mutual
3:57
they're voting so it's the token holders
3:58
and they it is a staking process
4:00
involved in that and one of the one of
4:03
the restrictions that we do have right
4:04
now is that the decision to make a claim
4:08
has to be publicly available so one of
4:12
the things we're starting with is my
4:13
contract cover which is if there's a bug
4:15
or hack in the spy contracts then we pay
4:17
a claim and say you by looking at the on
4:20
chain transactions you can see exactly
4:23
what happened so there's kind of
4:24
verifiable data source there so so the
4:27
earth that is a restriction right now
4:30
but also when we grow and compete we're
4:32
expecting that to kind of scale down to
4:35
more localized teams that would assess
4:39
claims and things like that but that
4:40
requires scale and you know that's a bit
4:42
further down the path yeah that was my
4:44
next question and I guess does that
4:46
centralized things but ultimately if we
4:48
have health professionals deciding which
4:52
health claims should get made you
4:54
gentlemanlike the people are going to
4:55
complain all that centralized but is
4:57
there a reputation system further down
4:59
the road map at that type of thing well
5:01
I mean there's a there's an incentive
5:03
system for the claims assessment and if
5:05
you if you're not kind of good at doing
5:07
that then you're not gonna get rewarded
5:09
let's not be worth your time so we're
5:10
hoping the majority of this is self
5:12
selection look there's always going to
5:15
be degrees of centralization or
5:17
decentralization on this stuff like yeah
5:19
you're not gonna have a thousand people
5:21
voting on whether someone's medical
5:23
claim is valid it just doesn't make any
5:25
sense in yeah any in any realm really so
5:29
we have to
5:30
there are definitely trade-offs here and
5:32
we're just kind of going for that full
5:34
mutual model where it's the members that
5:36
have the say so I know like a lot of
5:39
projects they say decentralize but then
5:41
what people start to critique and say
5:43
well you're not a hundred percent
5:43
decentralized but at the end of the day
5:45
if you're cutting out all the middlemen
5:47
in the traditional world
5:48
I guess just making a more decentralized
5:50
better product more efficient yeah yeah
5:53
that's right we're taking a similar
5:55
approach but it's we realized very early
5:58
on that it was going to be very
5:59
technically challenging to be fully
6:02
fully decentralized and we could spend
6:06
five years doing a great research
6:07
project and come up with something and
6:09
probably miss the mark so we prefer to
6:12
come for at least something and then you
6:15
trade on it and then decentralize
6:16
further over time so yeah we don't we do
6:19
have some centralized
6:20
elements to it but with the aim of kind
6:23
of removing those as many points as
6:25
possible yeah and I guess for people at
6:27
home
6:28
you mentioned that there's going to be
6:29
tokens at stake a theorem is also moving
6:32
to proof of stake and they're tinkering
6:34
with what their penalties are going to
6:36
be for doing the wrong thing so they're
6:37
talking about
6:38
you know slashing a percentage or maybe
6:40
even all of your tokens is there an easy
6:43
way for you to explain is that the same
6:45
as what if theorem are trying to do with
6:46
your model or what are the subtle
6:47
differences yeah we have a few staking
6:50
mechanisms but one of the most I guess
6:52
the probably the biggest one is when you
6:54
do risk assessment so basically they are
6:57
kind of like an underwriting process
6:58
like in insurance so deciding which my
7:01
contracts are secure so the idea is that
7:04
the members of the mutual stake they may
7:05
need token against my contracts that
7:07
they think is secure and the more people
7:08
that state the lower the price for other
7:10
people to fight their cover and so then
7:13
when there's a claim or if there's a
7:15
claim then the stakes get burned so
7:18
there's a real mechanism and then if
7:20
there's a claimant it gets better so
7:22
it's very um it's very kind of specific
7:24
if there's no claims opening so yeah
7:27
it's a bit it's kind of a bit easy to
7:30
tell if you've done a good job there
7:32
rather than you know with proofs they
7:34
are you offline are you being a
7:36
malicious or how does that kind of work
7:37
and does this become if I was really
7:41
good at making a lot of decisions
7:44
the rewards are fairly higher to the
7:45
point where it could almost turn into a
7:47
little a little business like I know a
7:49
lot of projects are experimenting with
7:51
what's the right percentage to reward
7:53
people for the work that they're doing
7:55
yeah that's what that's our aim well
7:58
actually just epic way back one of the
8:01
things I really like about this
8:02
technologies that opens up jobs for
8:05
people that may not be able to access
8:06
them in different parts of the world but
8:09
you can kind of do this from anywhere
8:10
and so that's that's the that's the idea
8:13
and that's the goal
8:15
it's the the rewards on the risk
8:17
assessment it definitely linked to how
8:18
many people buy the cover so you kind of
8:21
become like a distributor it's not like
8:22
a feast in it tips in a year or whatever
8:26
it's definitely kind of linked to the
8:29
actual outcome so is there a preferred
8:33
example that you like to give to people
8:34
I know if italic was talking about if
8:37
you've got cycling insurance and there's
8:39
a cyclone the Oracles of the voters
8:41
confirm that the wind conditions that
8:44
temperature the smart contract
8:45
automatically pays out all these people
8:47
is that I guess the how it works in a
8:49
nutshell yeah yeah
8:52
I mean generally I mean the big one of
8:55
the big use those use cases we've got
8:56
right now is people participating in
8:58
deep fire they lock up money in lending
9:00
protocols where you need to pop or
9:02
whatever to earn some interest and then
9:03
they come to us and buy some cover in
9:06
case there's a hack those by contracts
9:10
and they lose the funds and so if that
9:13
was to happen same compound went down
9:16
for example then they submit a claim and
9:19
they go to the voting pool and the
9:21
voting process results and they get paid
9:23
yes basically upwards so you're ensuring
9:25
smart contracts in the digital world as
9:27
well as ensuring real things in the real
9:29
world yeah we say we just start we're
9:32
definitely just starting with my
9:33
contract covering the crypto native
9:35
risks with the plan to get to more
9:38
regular products in the future
9:40
the idea Winchell's actually work really
9:42
well when they start community-based and
9:45
and and so then they can get some scale
9:48
and also there's no actual like no real
9:53
coverage you can get from the regular
9:55
insurance markets for this stuff right
9:56
now we're the only real option so I mean
10:00
that's good for us but just in general
10:01
al I mean if if we're building a
10:05
parallel financial economy every economy
10:07
needs insurance of subscription to make
10:10
it successful
10:10
it's just underlying financial
10:12
infrastructure and so that's that's kind
10:15
of what we're trying to be for the good
10:16
Joe thank you so out of interest if a
10:19
lot of these DIY projects are officing
10:21
offerings a 10% a year
10:23
what would my insurance costs you know
10:26
1% or 2% and when you take into account
10:28
the actual risk would you do that
10:30
I guess water's gotta find its level at
10:31
some stage but how does that all work at
10:33
the moment yeah so most of the like beat
10:36
defy contracts are at at a kind of
10:39
minimum pricing level which is 1.3
10:41
percent per year so the so the economics
10:43
worked quite well for you know if you
10:46
can then 10 percent or I mean it's
10:48
currently about six or seven or
10:49
something but you know it works it works
10:52
quite well from that perspective
10:53
yeah and was I reading that you guys are
10:56
considering with all the pooled funds
10:58
also lending them out and some interests
11:01
yourselves and in that situation if
11:03
you're insuring that con
11:05
fact is that it doesn't work I guess
11:08
yeah so so basically insurance companies
11:12
make a whole bunch of their money by
11:14
just investing the float or their assets
11:16
that they have and probably you know
11:18
half their money or something like that
11:19
yeah and so we're currently not doing
11:21
that but we definitely want to do it in
11:23
the future we just have to wait for the
11:25
right options to appear if we weren't so
11:28
they kind of put our money in compound
11:29
when we're covering compound then if
11:30
that happens then we've got a really big
11:32
problem so we don't want to do that
11:34
however there are kind of two big
11:36
options that we see right now on the
11:39
soon and short term horizon are the the
11:41
die savings rate with maker and also
11:45
staking and proof of stake with the
11:47
theorem to pretend that goes live and we
11:50
see there is a very good type of
11:53
interest bearing low interest bearing a
11:55
low-risk type returns which is what we
11:59
need to make it work and you familiar
12:01
with synthetics and is that another one
12:03
where you consider minting earning
12:06
rewards and whatnot potentially I think
12:09
we're more likely to offer cover on
12:11
synthetics but we want we basically want
12:15
to offer cover on things synthetics
12:16
because lots of people wanted because
12:17
they upgrade their contract scrap quite
12:20
regularly yeah but that's also a
12:21
challenge from our product point of view
12:23
to make sure that they don't introduce
12:25
malicious code stop and claim and things
12:28
so we we're definitely working out how
12:30
to do that but it's on horizon and
12:32
there's a lot of similarities there from
12:35
another point of view that they've got
12:37
all their funds pulled for traders and
12:39
trying to hedge risk in a way I guess
12:40
there's been a bit of overlap with what
12:42
you guys are doing that model yeah I
12:45
think there's a whole bunch of the
12:47
similarities between things like
12:48
prediction markets derivatives insurance
12:51
they're all they're kind of very closely
12:53
related there's obviously a lot of it's
12:55
about hedging risk can also be leveraged
12:58
risk but that can be about hedging risk
13:00
as well and and different different kind
13:04
of tools work better for different
13:05
scenarios and things like that so just
13:07
in general I think they're very
13:09
complementary type things and they make
13:12
a lot of sense to kind of work together
13:14
in a lot of ways so you guys doing some
13:16
work we've Olga or is that
13:19
prediction markets again just a bit of
13:21
an overlap rather than competition and
13:23
correct me if I'm wrong with that model
13:24
is a someone trader on the other side of
13:27
that bet changing those odds are they're
13:29
also prediction markets out there that
13:31
are using the pooled model not as far as
13:35
I'm aware so I mean I think the main
13:38
difference between prediction markets
13:40
and my insurance pools just in general
13:43
the fact that you've got under
13:46
collateralization on the insurance pools
13:48
and fully quite full collateralization
13:50
on the prediction market so the
13:53
insurance pool should be much more
13:54
capital efficient and be able to offer
13:56
better prices for extreme events so ones
13:59
that are very unlikely to happen but the
14:01
prediction markets are very good when
14:03
you've got like a 50/50 or tight outcome
14:07
and it's more flexible like you can
14:10
release a product really quickly and
14:11
stuff like that so I think they're
14:14
they're definitely complementary but
14:16
insurance does more and more about
14:19
managing those extreme events like a
14:22
test dystrophic type stuff
14:24
and that's where producer markets for a
14:26
good would be because you have to fully
14:27
close
14:28
yeah and I guess I'm just the law of
14:31
large numbers as you grow you don't want
14:33
to get a one in a million event early on
14:35
or if you have a hundred different
14:37
markets it doesn't matter if you get one
14:38
because they're not gonna happen in
14:40
other markets yeah it's definitely the
14:43
diversification of risk that's what
14:44
that's what insurance is all about and
14:47
that's why it can work so you know if
14:49
you've got a certain amount of capital
14:51
in your pool you can cover many many
14:53
times that in risk but for a prediction
14:56
market you'd only need one to one
14:57
because you kind of have like a
15:00
two-sided market for each risk and then
15:02
you need to fully close so I haven't
15:04
seen any prediction markets with a
15:06
pooling approach maybe that it's on the
15:09
horizon I don't know but but you know
15:11
but that would be closer to a kind of
15:13
insurance type structure yeah I guess
15:17
changing gears a little bit I want to
15:19
talk about the financial crisis because
15:21
I know a lot of things that are
15:22
happening on etherium and defy their
15:24
standard say well if we had all these
15:26
markets and we knew the bonds and the
15:28
price and the risk blockchain would give
15:31
it all more transparency and it wouldn't
15:33
and we'd know who owned what you guys
15:36
you know is that longer-term on the
15:38
roadmap about doing this kind of thing
15:40
financial derivatives in that world is
15:41
getting crazy at the moment
15:43
yeah I'm not I'm not necessarily on the
15:46
roadmap perhaps but I guess it could be
15:48
but I think just in general like the
15:52
transparency is going to help massively
15:54
in that type of like the the other side
15:58
of it is that we're building later book
16:01
on negative local mega Blok and if one
16:02
of them goes down then the whole lot of
16:04
things go down so so I think there is
16:07
systemic risk and it's just perhaps
16:10
perhaps taking a bit of a different form
16:12
but and I think we all need to be very
16:16
aware of that of what we're doing and I
16:19
mean you know but kind of running before
16:22
we could walk on a whole bunch of this
16:23
stuff right now but it is still
16:25
relatively small and if something
16:27
happens it'll be relatively contained
16:28
obviously not good for the people that
16:30
are in there but but I guess in general
16:33
like we're hoping to be at least one
16:36
subtraction on the risk levels that the
16:40
whole space is accumulating and you know
16:43
I think you know for this base to kind
16:45
of get really serious kind of grow up
16:48
get a bit more financial announced
16:53
behind it I mean we got it we got to
16:54
have that fat fast experimentation but
16:56
at some point we also have to put the
16:57
controls in to make sure that it's
16:59
working okay and it's all more robust
17:02
and so you know I think we're
17:04
progressing along that path and
17:05
hopefully nothing massive blows up
17:07
before we get there yeah so I guess what
17:10
sort of things are you ensuring at the
17:12
moment because I know just you know even
17:14
the hot wing of Bitcoin custody and
17:15
insurance is becoming a big thing if
17:18
you've got that sort of demand at the
17:19
moment you mentioned people want for
17:21
synthetics have you done a hundred smart
17:23
contracts already did I read recently oh
17:25
yes my contract over there probably
17:29
covering about 20 different different
17:32
contracts so yeah so it's going it's
17:34
going really well so but I guess we're
17:37
just starting with the one product is in
17:39
covering the hack or bug smart contracts
17:43
on on ethereum but we're definitely
17:45
looking to expand into
17:46
and crypto native risks especially where
17:49
the insurance companies aren't
17:51
comfortable playing is they basically
17:53
there's a big knowledge gap and we can
17:55
help out with that so yeah there's lots
17:58
of stuff in there that we could be
17:59
looking at I think it's a tremendous
18:00
opportunity so many people ask us about
18:03
the you know compound and they want to
18:06
put that money in there in a low
18:07
interest rate environment but they're
18:08
worried about their risk so I think a
18:10
lot of people would be happy to pay that
18:11
1% insurance yeah and I know that's
18:14
that's what I've seen seen most of our
18:17
demand so yeah it's definitely if people
18:19
get intrigued when you say you can enter
18:21
percent or whatever it is yeah on your
18:24
money if they don't immediately think
18:26
you're trying to scare or something but
18:29
but I think yeah there's this happy
18:31
people gate okay fine but what's the
18:33
risk of taking on and I think right now
18:36
we've got a bunch of crypto people that
18:38
are fine with kind of gambling which is
18:40
you know okay that's fine that's good as
18:43
well but I think to kind of step up to
18:45
the most serious businesses and get a
18:49
bit more expansion into I guess read
18:51
more regular people then we're gonna
18:53
need more kind of robust systems and I
18:56
guess hopefully we're part of that yeah
18:57
I always tell people 5 or 10 percent a
19:00
month is is the pyramid scheme 5 or 10%
19:03
a year he's defy and even that's her I
19:06
guess risky and very small in terms of
19:08
the number of participants at the moment
19:10
so makes me want to get to was the token
19:13
so an exam is your token for the staking
19:16
and people always say you know why do
19:17
you need a token why couldn't you use
19:19
eath or what not so what are all the
19:20
utilities there yeah so basically the
19:25
token represents your membership of the
19:28
mutual and so you can use that to buy
19:33
cover state with risk assessments they
19:35
can claims assessment and voting
19:37
governance also if the members were to
19:41
kind of vote to shut the whole thing
19:43
down then it's kind of the proportional
19:48
ownership of a whole mutual I guess one
19:52
other interesting thing is does actually
19:53
have we're kind of down but we're
19:55
wrapped in a legal entity so the token
19:58
does have legal rights in the UK
20:00
and you join if you join the mutual the
20:04
doubt that as a member then you actually
20:05
join the company in the UK is a kind of
20:07
member membership organization and so we
20:10
have we have a pool of assets with the
20:12
met which members jointly owned and
20:14
essentially the tokens the way of
20:16
governing what to do with those assets
20:18
in whatever shape or form pay our planes
20:20
governance etc so does that mean it
20:22
won't be freely traded all across
20:24
exchanges and that well potentially I
20:28
don't know we I mean the thing is
20:30
there's a whitelist approach and the
20:31
token can only be owned by the members
20:34
which is very similar to how like
20:36
security tokens and these things work so
20:39
right now those types of things aren't
20:41
heavily traded on exchanges but that's
20:43
potentially coming as well so yeah I
20:47
mean I guess the other aspect of it is
20:49
we are running a blending curve so you
20:52
can buy and sell directly with the
20:54
application okay yeah it's one that I'm
20:57
definitely interested in so I will look
20:59
into it more in terms of off the token I
21:01
always love when there's something in a
21:03
new industry and at the moment you guys
21:04
are the only ones in insurance so yeah
21:07
I'm definitely looking into that more is
21:09
there anything else we haven't touched
21:10
on today that you think's interesting to
21:12
talk about no not particular think I
21:16
covered a whole bunch of different stuff
21:17
I mean just in general I love the fact
21:20
that defies just trying to build this
21:23
parallel financial economy for when I
21:26
don't know when people get
21:27
disenfranchised or can't get access from
21:29
the regular systems and say yeah I'm
21:33
just really excited to be kind of part
21:35
of this space and hopefully helping out
21:38
you know real people down the road yeah
21:40
I've always been I've always been a
21:42
Bitcoin a bit of a massive etherion bull
21:44
since I first wrote about it and it was
21:46
hard watching all these other projects
21:47
and promises spring up and I owned a lot
21:50
of the decentralized ones and they're
21:51
really coming to the forefront in the
21:53
past six to twelve months like I said
21:55
the Lego bricks and building on top of
21:57
each other it's so great to say so do
21:59
you have any little favorite projects or
22:01
maybe ones that are a little bit more
22:03
hidden they're doing interesting things
22:04
I love just the smaller smaller ones
22:08
like things like pull together or
22:12
or something like that they're just
22:14
they're just doing some really basic
22:16
stuff as a you'd think but it's actually
22:19
kind of building this really easy to use
22:22
financial primitive if you want to call
22:23
it but the it fundamentally looked
22:26
really really useful that you can't do
22:28
easily at all in the current financial
22:32
world and so those are the things that
22:34
personate me I kind of think that you
22:36
know we've got this existing financial
22:37
world we started by building the things
22:40
that we know exists in aetherium because
22:44
we know that they kind of work so we're
22:46
trying to just copy the model and bring
22:47
it across the scene but but they're
22:49
really interesting things to me is that
22:50
what are the new things that you could
22:52
do that you couldn't really do before
22:53
and I think we're seeing starting to see
22:56
more and more of those things to come
22:57
about how do they think a couple of
23:00
those really working is going to lead to
23:02
that's what's potentially going to give
23:05
us the traction with them real people
23:07
because of something fundamentally new
23:08
rather than just you can it's an
23:10
alternative there are any examples super
23:13
futuristic stuff that you've thought
23:15
about of you know AI starting to ensure
23:18
all sorts of bizarre things anything
23:20
real far off that you thought about but
23:26
I mean but the other thing is right if
23:28
you have blockchain or if there is the
23:30
kind of layer of this stuff that kind of
23:34
gives you the fundamental thing in an
23:37
insurance world that it gives you is
23:38
that open API architecture so you've
23:41
kind of built an insurance company that
23:44
is fully open that anyone can integrate
23:46
with and that's like math that's a
23:48
massive step forward over the current
23:50
legacy insurers and you know you can
23:53
anyone if anyone can build like a I have
23:56
connected to IOT devices and stuff like
23:59
that which is what the regular insurance
24:00
industry is doing a lot of but they're
24:02
doing it very manually because that's
24:04
the infrastructure they're building with
24:05
but if we can do it in an automated
24:08
fashion and provide that solid kind of
24:10
through your data layer with clear data
24:12
structures and stuff that you can
24:13
interact with I think that has some
24:16
potential to be be quite huge but you
24:19
know it's you know it's got a road to go
24:21
obviously but to me that's where we're
24:23
headed yeah I guess the final question I
24:25
had
24:26
we recently chatted to some guys that
24:28
are doing securities on the XRP ledger
24:30
and we've had a few projects that are
24:32
building on a OS so what's the reason
24:34
for you guys when people say at theorems
24:36
too slow and it can't scale is it just
24:38
because of the sheer number of
24:39
developers and interaction we see the
24:45
security one of the things that was
24:47
pretty critical for us is being able to
24:50
have no one costing the assets of mutual
24:52
that was fundamental to what we wanted
24:54
to achieve in my opinion the only
24:56
security settings that can handle that
25:00
right now
25:00
atheria good but it's too hard to build
25:05
it so that was basically the only the
25:08
only choice I mean in terms of
25:10
scalability the scalability of etherium
25:12
right now it's absolutely fine for what
25:14
we're doing but basically doing
25:15
high-value load lower numbers of
25:17
transactions so that's fine but
25:19
obviously it's going to become an issue
25:21
at some point and but I'm just trusting
25:23
the whole pile of really really smart
25:26
people that are working on this stuff to
25:28
figure it out I'm sure I'm sure they
25:30
will absolutely we've already seen I'm
25:33
sure you guys could even go to a state
25:34
channel or something if you had to lay
25:36
it till as well so there's already
25:38
solutions there yeah exactly
25:40
you know optimistic roll ups or whatever
25:42
you want to call it and you know we
25:43
there's a whole there's a whole bunch of
25:44
options they say like you know I don't
25:47
know what the exact solution is going to
25:48
be now right now it's working fine but
25:51
there's definitely stuff coming that we
25:52
can transition to if we need to awesome
25:55
that's relatively short but I think we
25:56
touched on everything I wanted to hear
25:58
and I think this is a really interesting
25:59
little project so thanks so much for
26:00
joining us today
26:01
oh thank you good to be on is thanks
26:04
guys
