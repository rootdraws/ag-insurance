Intro
0:08
this video will be a bit long so i don't
0:10
want to have so many information
0:11
in there because those are the the
0:13
primary you know very high level things
0:15
that you can find in the previous video
0:16
today we want to go a bit deeper
How it works
0:19
so how it works this diagram is done
0:23
is done by nexus metro and i think it
0:24
gives a very good snapshot of how the
0:26
thing works
0:28
so you have three types of people in the
0:29
system or three types of participants in
0:31
the system
0:32
you have a member so these members are
0:35
you know people
0:35
who sign up for the membership and pay
0:38
in
0:39
paid for the membership fee and you can
0:41
purchase the nxm token
0:43
not ram not wrapped nxm but nxm token
0:46
itself
0:47
so you have a member and as a member you
0:49
can buy cover
0:50
and then you have two other types of
0:52
participants the first one
0:54
is a risk assessor so risk assessor will
0:57
check the risk of
0:58
something and then the second one uh the
1:00
third one is a claim assessor so the
1:02
claim assessor would
1:03
check the claims of something okay so
1:06
that's
1:07
the three different types of
1:08
participants right the member
1:10
the person who defines risk the person
1:12
who defines claims
1:14
how do they work and how is it
1:15
decentralized okay let's see
1:17
so we have nexus mutual as a platform to
1:20
aggregate all these three participants
1:22
together aggregate
1:23
the insurance covers aggregate the funds
1:25
available
1:27
as a member you let's say i'm a member
1:30
and i go to nexus mutual and i go to avi
1:32
and i want to borrow something from ravi
1:35
and so i want to protect my funds that
1:37
are in that
1:37
that is in avi so i'm a member
1:41
i buy cover from nexus mutual and
1:44
nexus mutual has some funds available to
1:46
be covering
1:48
this to be covering rv i like to cover
1:50
my
1:51
my insurance cover for trading
1:54
or for landing and borrowing on ave so i
1:56
could buy a cover
1:58
now um let's say the price is going to
2:01
be
2:01
0.5 eth for example it's a lot less than
2:04
that but let's let's just say that
2:06
so 0.5 eth and this is the
2:09
and i want to cover let's say 300 000
2:13
ease
2:13
that i'm going to be boring and landing
2:14
on ave so the cost
2:16
i don't know what the exact these are
2:18
just arbitrary numbers but just imagine
2:20
300 000 that's boring and landing on ave
2:22
and the cost to
2:24
for insurance is 0.5 and that 0.5 if
2:27
goes into nexus mutual which is you know
2:29
a big
2:29
pot of funds and
2:33
how how does this risk assessor and
2:35
claim assessors work
2:37
first we need a risk assessor so risk
2:39
assessor will look at all the different
2:41
protocols
2:42
in in define and say that okay let's
2:45
do a deep dive in ave we're going to
2:47
look in our base protocol
2:49
and then we audit the code we look at
2:51
the general information that's on the
2:53
code
2:54
we look at how secure the code is and
2:57
usually this risk assessors
2:59
they they're experts in their own field
3:02
so
3:02
they could be smart contract coders they
3:04
could be developers they actually know
3:06
the thing
3:07
so they look at the risk and they say
3:10
okay
3:10
you know i think ava's protocol is very
3:12
secure and
3:14
i think this is a secure platform i
3:16
think this is a secure protocol
3:18
and i am going to stick some tokens
3:22
on this on the fact that i think this is
3:25
secure
3:26
so let's say i'm going to stake let's do
3:29
everything in eve okay because it's a
3:30
lot easier first
3:31
let's say i'm going to stick 100 each on
3:34
this or unless i'm going to stick 10
3:36
east 10 east on
3:38
ave protocol because i think it's secure
3:40
i've done the checks i've done the
3:41
audits there's no bugs and nothing will
3:43
happen
3:45
in the next and next 30 days because the
3:48
code doesn't change in the next 30 days
3:49
there's no upgrades and everything so i
3:51
think
3:52
it's secure i'm going to take 10 eth
3:55
to to validate that
3:58
this this is um this protocol is
4:02
secure there is no bugs and everything
4:04
now because there's 10 eth in the pool
4:06
then the member like me can come in to
4:08
say that oh there's tennis available so
4:10
i can
4:11
i can purchase you know i can buy the
4:13
cover
4:14
and just in case anything happens that
4:16
risk that
4:17
risk assessor that amount of money the
4:20
pool can be used to pay out for my
4:22
for my borrowing and lending on ave
4:23
that's why i buy the insurance right
4:26
okay so that's the that's the general
4:28
idea and
4:29
what about claim assesses so risk
4:31
assessors are like step one in the game
4:33
right step one to look at these
4:34
protocols and say okay this
4:36
is risky this is not so risky they're
4:38
not risky one i'm gonna put money on
4:39
that the risky one i'm not gonna put my
4:41
money on there because
4:42
someone's gonna claim it and i'm gonna
4:43
lose my stake
4:45
then step two is a member coming in and
4:47
say oh i'm gonna use the protocol and i
4:49
want to get insurance for it because i'm
4:51
worried
4:52
and you buy the insurance now step three
4:54
it's what happens when things go wrong
4:56
what happens where you actually need
4:58
something went wrong
4:59
there's a bug in the code and you need
5:01
to get smart con
5:02
you need you need the insurance cover
5:05
that's the entire point of buying
5:06
insurance
5:07
to cover your losses and that's where
5:10
the third participant comes in they call
5:11
it the claims assessor
5:13
as you can imagine they assess the claim
5:15
so they look at
5:16
they look at the claims what you what
5:19
you said
5:20
and they will have a verdict the verdict
5:23
is either yes or no
5:24
and because right now nexus mutual only
5:27
covers a very very specific
5:29
niche risk which is the internal
5:32
technical risk
5:33
of the protocol which means like a bug
5:36
in the smart contract so it's a
5:38
technical bug
5:39
not an exploit a bug a technical bug is
5:43
that there's something wrong with the
5:44
smart contract
5:45
and as a result you as a member of me as
5:47
a member who bought the insurance
5:48
has to suffer the loss so that's what
5:50
they cover however
5:52
if the system is not a bug it's like a
5:55
maybe it's a technical risk from an
5:58
external
5:59
system or i mean one day
6:02
electricity shut off and you just can't
6:04
use your
6:05
your system or you can't use any of the
6:07
protocols or there's a
6:09
fault in the ethereum network in general
6:11
and all the
6:13
all the entire protocols don't work
6:15
that's something they do not cover
6:16
or if someone else if a hacker is
6:18
exploiting the system
6:20
through you know human exploit or
6:22
governance exploit
6:23
or whatever other exploit but not smart
6:26
contract exploit
6:27
that the insurance doesn't cover for
6:29
that so you know insurance is very
6:31
specific right so
6:32
that is something specific they cover
Claim assessors
6:35
now
6:35
we can use machines to determine that
6:39
but we can't just only rely on machines
6:41
because using asking machines to verify
6:43
if machines aren't mistaken or not you
6:45
know it's a bit difficult to do
6:47
so that's where humans come in and these
6:48
are claim assessors
6:50
and to be a claim assessor you have to
6:51
stake your tokens
6:54
and to be a clean assessor and then you
6:56
you vote
6:57
yes this is an error and we need to pay
7:00
out like nexus mutual need to pay out
7:02
or no this is not something that nexus
7:04
mutual covers
7:05
this is like a governance exploit so we
7:08
can't
7:09
the insurance doesn't cover that so no
7:11
so that's what they do yes or no
7:13
so that's the general idea of how nexus
7:15
mutual work
7:16
and if you want to go a bit deeper when
7:19
a member
7:20
pays when a member buys a cover you know
7:22
that money is just
7:24
gone you can claim the money back
7:27
when there's an exploit and then you
7:29
just claim the amount of money that your
7:31
your insurance covers and then 50 of it
7:36
of the cover price goes to goes to the
7:39
staking reward for risk assesses
7:41
so what happens when things go if
7:44
nothing goes wrong
7:45
so the claim assesses are not involved
7:48
it's just a member and a risk assessor
7:49
so let's say i purchase my costs i'm
7:52
purchasing a 0.5 each
7:54
of insurance and nothing goes wrong for
7:56
the 20 days that i'm using
7:58
ave and so the 0.5 eth goes into the
8:01
reward pool
8:03
and 50 of it so 0.25 eth
8:06
goes will be given to the risk assessors
8:09
and they will be split by all the
8:10
different risk assessors
8:11
it's not just one risk risk assessor the
8:13
entire thing is distribution right
8:15
so i don't know you have like 20 100
8:16
risk assessors and then all the
8:18
different
8:19
members that purchase the the cover like
8:22
part of it goes to the different
8:24
all the different risk assesses if
8:25
nothing goes wrong and then you know the
8:28
rest of the
8:28
the cover price goes to other places
8:31
we're going to talk about it later
8:33
and what happens when something goes
8:34
wrong so when something goes wrong
8:36
the money that the risk assessor puts
8:39
you know
8:40
their state you know they don't get the
8:41
stake back anymore the stick will be
8:42
used to be refunding the members
8:45
and the claim assessors will come in and
8:47
they will stick their nxm token
8:49
and they will vote yes or no and
8:51
depending on that
8:52
they will get returns they will get
8:54
rewards in nxm tokens
8:56
and and that's the general idea
9:00
okay we're gonna go a little bit deeper
9:02
into later much later on
9:04
but this gives you a better scope to
9:07
start
9:07
understanding how nexus mutual works
9:10
what are the different
9:11
participants how do we align the
9:13
incentives because the entire thing
9:15
about insurance is
9:16
how do you align the incentives between
9:18
your principal and your agent
9:20
and how do you make sure that they work
9:21
hand in hand so that nobody exploits the
9:23
system
9:24
that is a detriment to another person
9:27
so how do we align that
9:30
so that that in general is how it works
9:33
and so
9:34
how do you use the token there isn't a
9:36
token called the nxm token
9:38
how do you use the token where is it
9:39
being used in general it's used in four
9:41
systems
9:42
the first one is to buy cover so
9:44
remember as a member i can purchase
9:46
cover
9:47
of the thing that i want to get
9:48
insurance for and i can purchase it
9:51
using nxm tokens
9:52
then eska as a risk assessor you know
9:55
the
9:56
guy who comes in and say that okay i've
9:58
done the check
9:59
on the smart contract no bugs i'm i'm
10:02
going to put
10:03
my sticks on there i'm going to put my
10:04
money where my mouth is and say that
10:06
there's no box it's safe
10:08
you can stick with nxm tokens and then
10:11
for claim assessors as well
10:12
i come in to be a claim assessor to to
10:15
say
10:16
to say that yes this smart contract is a
10:19
bug exploit versus this smart contract
10:21
is a governor's export that we don't
10:22
cover
10:23
so to be a claim assessor i have to
10:25
stake my nxm tokens as well
10:27
and lastly is governance so
10:31
if there's any governance required task
10:34
like if you want to vote on improvement
10:36
proposals then you stick your nxm token
10:39
as well or at least that's where nxm
10:40
token is used
10:41
and it can use to be voting so these are
10:43
the four general use cases of nxm token
