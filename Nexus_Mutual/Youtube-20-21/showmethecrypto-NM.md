in a world on the brink of disruption two men will bring you clarity by
0:16
interviewing some of the most intelligent and influential names in the
0:21
blockchain world welcome to show me the crypto
0:28
with your hosts wade patterson and elf lonergrin
Hugh Intro
0:34
well hi there and welcome to show me the crypto my name is wade patterson and i'm all flonogram we're a couple of friends
0:40
from canada who love learning about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology and we're happy you're along for the
0:46
ride whether you're a crypto virgin or you know your way around the block we hope our interviews with some of the
0:52
most intelligent and influential people in the blockchain space help deliver you with value and on this episode we're
1:00
joined by hugh carp founder of nexus mutual with 15 years of experience in
1:05
traditional insurance you stumbled across bitcoin in 2010 and was intrigued
1:10
by the concept but it wasn't until discovering ethereum in 2016 that he began to grasp the potential of merging
1:17
insurance with blockchain tech nexus mutual is a decentralized alternative to
1:22
insurance which uses the ethereum blockchain to create a risk sharing pool in the form of a mutual to return the
1:29
power of insurance to the people hugh welcome to show me the crypto
1:34
thanks very much guys great to be here and thanks for having me having me on yeah absolutely we're excited to have
1:39
this conversation and before we dive into all things nexus mutual which we will i'm just curious about your
1:46
upbringing and and just kind of what you aspired to be growing up i mean was insurance always on your radar what drew
1:53
you to that career path yeah a good question um i guess avoid i'd always been pretty
2:00
decent at math i guess at school um and so um my my father is actually an actor
2:06
um as well so i guess i knew about insurance a lot from from that um i guess university kind of had to make a
2:13
choice between doing something engineering type related or um computer science or um actuarial studies and
2:19
decided to go actuarial um i don't know i can't exactly remember why at that point but um seemed like the right thing
2:24
at the time um and then kind of just progressed down that path and yeah i guess they started along the more
2:30
corporate um insurance company actuarial professional i guess career path and
2:37
um then yeah then took a bit of a left turn um and they started diving into crypto so yeah
Hugh's Discovery of Bitcoin
2:43
so and wade mentioned you stumbled upon bitcoin in 2010 which is you know super
2:48
early on a lot of people hadn't heard of bitcoin at that point uh when you heard of it and you were
2:53
intrigued did you go ahead and acquire some bitcoin or was it just interest at that point and a
3:00
concept that you then carried on with your everyday life kind of thing yeah no i i did buy a little bit um just
3:07
a few hundred dollars worth which is you know but still at that price that's a lot um and i would have done well for
3:13
you yeah there's a bit more a bit more to the story but um yeah i i just i got
3:19
some just because i wanted to like experiment with it and just like you know send some funds around see what you could do like i even tried mining on a
3:26
browser like um like but that's how early it was you could still do that type of stuff without even like half
3:32
decent hardware it still kind of worked um i said like i sent a few text messages if you could you could send
3:38
premium text messages and people would send you back bitcoins it was um it was a bit of a weird time anyway yeah like i
3:44
i didn't honestly i didn't really know how it worked underneath but i just thought it was really kind of fascinating that you could send
3:50
money to someone else without any kind of person in the middle and it just kind of works and you know i i just played
3:56
around with it for a bit um left some money on some random exchange because i felt like that was
4:02
more secure than me holding it and that exchange got hacked and i basically lost you know pretty much all of it but um
4:07
you know i guess experience and all the rest of it it helps is everyone kind of has to go
4:13
through those types of things in crypto if it feels you're gonna yeah have have you kind of baptism moments i
4:18
guess um but um but yeah i i guess i put it down after that because i
4:24
found it fascinating but i didn't really know what to do with it because i guess payments wasn't necessarily my thing
4:29
and just in general like what drew you to the space was it friends that knew about bitcoin or something
4:36
like that at that time or were you just stumbling upon it online or how did you come across it
4:41
yeah i guess i was i've always been kind of interested in like starting my own business and i i guess from the
4:47
being from the insurance space like selling intangible goods like um it kind of fits a little bit
4:53
with like um digital currency and stuff like that um but i i guess
4:59
i was looking at various different business opportunities and i guess they all kind of relied on connecting
5:05
different businesses up and relying on they still of them still operating um and like so i guess one of the
5:11
fundamental things when you get down to it that fascinated me was you know kind of the resilience and the you know it it
5:17
will be there um and it will operate and you can build something on top of it and no one can pull it out from underneath
5:23
you um that type of thing i i found really really powerful well and then as i also mentioned the
Leaving Traditional Insurance for Blockchain
5:29
bio there so ethereum 2016 around that time you discover it and then you kind
5:35
of have this aha moment of understanding okay maybe there's an opportunity here for insurance but still considering you
5:42
had been in the traditional space for 15 years was that a scary process to walk away from that traditional industry or
5:49
was it something like you're like i'm ready to go like this is my opportunity yeah i mean i think um well i did take a
5:54
while um like i didn't leave until the end of 2017. um and so i spent a good
6:01
year 18 months or so like really kind of getting into the details understanding the tech and understanding how it could
6:07
work mapping it out you know doing all the kind of background work and spend time and stuff and and and then it
6:13
seemed right to take the take the leap at that point it was also i guess a point in my career where i kind of
6:19
been in the same role for a little bit looking for something else to do and so this yeah it seemed like a natural jumping-off point
6:25
uh when you say you were kind of like doing all the research and planning i mean was that like are you a developer
6:31
were you learning to code like how did you have other people helping you out was it purely business
6:38
um i don't code i have coded in the past i'm absolutely terrible but um but i guess i know
6:45
enough to probably be dangerous and more of a problem than um helpful but um but
6:51
i i think that gave me a i did enough research to kind of understand the core mechanics
6:57
and what you can do obviously that's not the level you need to actually code something up but it gave me the deep enough insights to
7:04
work out how to structure something where the big restrictions were those types of tricks and so i spent a lot of
7:09
the time researching regulatory legal type framework stuff
7:15
which is a big part of nexus actually um and then but then also like the mechanics um and how we run the
7:21
economics and those types of things and so there was a lot of work on that on that side of stuff
7:27
before getting into the actual coding one of the things we were joking about before we hit record here is the fact
What is Nexus Mutual?
7:33
that like often myself know very limited amount about insurance and that type of thing so with that in mind
7:40
what is nexus mutual how exactly does it work yeah probably one of the easiest things is probably starts easy with this bit of
7:46
a story um so um mutuals are actually a very very old
7:52
concept um they're like millennia oh like so thousands of years like basically a group of people a small
7:58
community just think of them like a village or whatever just coming together sharing risks together and one of the
8:04
most obvious things is like um you know they'll kind of pull money or pull resources i guess and if someone in the
8:11
village or community dies then the rest of the community looks after their family whether that's through monetary
8:17
stuff or actually just helping them out work wise giving them food or whatever that type of stuff and that's kind of the earliest
8:23
um signs of like communities sharing risk together by themselves and
8:29
and so over time like communities are really good at kind of coming together and doing this themselves when they see a need because that's that makes it
8:35
makes the whole community stronger and more resilient and and i guess this has happened like so
8:40
many times over history and everything like you know the shipping is probably the big thing that turned insurance from just
8:47
community-based stuff into like real kind of commercial um transactions and things with um you know
8:53
i guess lloyd's and then other um like babylonia and like all these types
8:59
of things can come together and you'd really turn it into a commercial arrangement where um where you've got
9:04
like specific experts backing specific risks or ships like you know will the ship
9:09
make it to deliver its goods to another country or will get will its sink or get
9:15
stolen by pirates or whatever right that's that's that's where it's come from and
9:20
and so that's very that's very very good but i guess one of the things that
9:26
um mutual's always struggled with was kind of scaling and like getting bigger insurance is all
9:31
about like diversification like the more risks you have the bigger the pooler capital the more efficient you are you
9:37
can spread the risk among more people which means it's a cheaper cost for everyone involved and so scale is a
9:42
really big critical component of insurance and and so everything looks to try and scale and
9:49
the way that insurance has scaled over time is essentially
9:54
they get capital from specific capital providers so the share markets or stuff like that and and so you end up with on
10:01
one side you've got the community of people that want to offload risk and then you have the capital providers that are taking the risk and that's the way
10:07
we've scaled things um but but i guess what we're saying with nexus is
10:13
now we have a new technology that can connect people directly
10:19
and we can actually scale within the community so um like one example i guess is like if
10:25
you've got two communities differently they've got their own risk sharing pools they may not trust
10:30
each other to come together to form a better bigger diversified re-sharing pool because they don't trust each other
10:36
to pay out the claims or whatever it is right um and so here we can have smart contracts that bridge that trust and so
10:42
you can group people together where you couldn't easily group them together before um and so because we've got this
10:48
new technology we can scale at the community level rather than um essentially going like the
10:55
shareholder capital group where you have to kind of get these independent people with the money that to bring it in and then you've got this naturally
11:01
conflicted position because you've got shareholders that obviously don't want to pay out claims and you have people
11:06
who want to pay out claims and so there's a definite um you know misalignment of interests you know it
11:12
works and it largely works because there's big regulation in place to make sure that it works um but if without
11:18
that regulation it probably wouldn't um and so here what we're saying is you can create a system which keeps everyone's
11:24
interest more aligned because you can have the tokenomics and everything kind of i'm all in one group keep the
11:30
communities together but allow them to to scale together um and so yeah that's a that's a bit of a roundabout way of
11:36
saying it but conceptually um it's really about going back to the roots of
11:41
insurance but now we have a new technology to coordinate people a lot more efficiently than we did before
Scaling Insurance with Blockchain Tech
11:48
it seems like a concept that it would only be possible with
11:53
blockchain technology is it is that the case or is there any sort of
11:59
i don't know other version of mutuals that does exist in the modern day that
12:06
you know that aren't built on blockchain yeah i mean mutuals exist um kind of in
12:11
a whole bunch of different countries all everywhere they generally struggle to scale um to largemouth that's not to say
12:18
there aren't some big mutuals like there are like bupa is a big global mutual massachusetts mutual is huge as well
12:26
um but generally what happens is mutuals get to a certain point they kind of max
12:31
out their particular community and then to scale further they have to join with another community and then
12:38
what happens is they often demutualize so they actually convert to a shareholder company they pay out all of
12:43
the members give them some shares it's kind of a bribe or this is why we kind of want to convert
12:49
to a shareholder company you know and and then ideally that means that they can scale further and have a full profit
12:55
motive and it's more efficient anyway that's that's the argument but what we're saying is we can use this
13:01
tech to actually um it gives us more opportunity to scale so it's not that mutuals can't scale like right now they
13:07
just generally struggle to right um and you've got this background of 15
13:13
years in traditional insurance you know what's it like
13:18
moving into the blockchain space creating this new solution for for
13:24
insurance and uh you know having that cater to the d5 space and the blockchain industry as a
13:31
whole is it a completely different world you know are these a lot of similarities still and crossover and the technology
13:38
is just different yeah i think it's it's different on quite a lot of levels i guess
13:43
fundamentally it's it's the same thing a bunch of people pulling risks together and you know you pay your cost of cover
13:50
and then you get a claim and although so the you know the fundamentals are there um but i guess the product's different
13:56
like we're doing a new product like no one's ever written this product before we started writing it um
14:01
so i can get into that in a bit of detail we're doing new products um designed specifically for the crypto
14:06
communities um that regular financial institutions don't insurers don't offer um we're we're
14:14
doing things entirely on ethereum on on chain and and i guess we're also doing some i
14:22
think there's interesting stuff on the legal side as well so there's quite a lot of different elements but i think fundamentally you know insurance
14:29
in the traditional sense it's generally quite slow it's quite slow to innovate they've got a lot of
14:36
um i guess barriers to entry look at a lot of moats right yeah so they don't need to move fast um and crypto's
14:43
probably one of the fastest moving industries out there so um it's kind of uh that's that's
14:48
definitely a big big change um and um yeah i mean i talked to my ex-colleagues
14:54
and other people i know from the industry and stuff yeah i've been in the fast pace for quite a
15:00
while now and so it's definitely different when you speak to them so
15:05
we can yeah i notice it let's just say that um that's totally fair i mean i i can
15:11
relate as a user so i did um i utilized nexus mutual
15:18
uh it's been a while now i don't have any like active coverage but i think about a year or year and a half ago i
15:24
utilized the service and yeah the the the lack of barriers because of that the
15:30
the accessibility of the technology i mean it's crazy when you think about going and getting any type of insurance for
15:36
anything in the traditional world and oh you know you gotta go through a person obviously um and then you gotta
15:44
go through all the steps sign a whole bunch of legal documents blah blah blah they probably
15:49
gotta do credit checks and all this and meanwhile in crypto you just you know
15:54
enter your address sign a contract you're good to go kind of thing so um yeah it it's super easy low barrier
16:02
just like almost anything in d5 which is um so great so you did mention a few of your different
Coverage Offered by Nexus Mutual
16:09
you know that nexus mutual's doing a few different things you have a couple a few different products and you're working on
16:15
other products from your website it mentions there's three types of coverage currently um
16:21
yield token coverage protocol coverage and custodian coverage can you maybe
16:26
break those down for our audience like what do those mean why would we why would someone go look at utilizing nexus
16:32
mutual yeah i'll start with the custodial coverage um that's kind of like a c5
16:38
cover so like um if it comes against like the coin bases or finances or nexo or celsius or
16:44
someone like that where they custody your coins um and say they could lose them they could get hacked or whatever
16:50
so you're handing over your essentially their rights to the private keys or whatever so they're holding those on
16:55
your behalf and they could get hacked etc so obviously lots of potential incidents have happened but
17:01
lots of incidents have happened in the past like mount gox and like a whole bunch of other ones um and so that's
17:06
specifically designed for that risk and a lot of the users um but the with the nexus i mean this is a
17:13
theme throughout most of our products right now uh they want to deposit coins with like a yield app or crypto.com or
17:19
something to earn yield um and then um they buy cover with nexus and they you
17:24
know earn a net yield a bit lower but they're still a lot higher they get in their bank account um and be a lot
17:30
better off so that's kind of the main um the main one with the the custody cover
17:35
um the protocol cover and yield token government basically the same fundamental like customer um motivation to buy
17:43
you're looking to deploy but this is for d5 instead so both protocol cover and your token cover g5 type products um and
17:50
so they cover against um d5 risk so you want to deploy your money into a d5
17:55
protocol like a compound or an army or a curve or something like that um and you
18:01
want to you know earn yield um but you're because you're giving you're putting your money into those smart
18:07
contracts and those smart contracts could have bugs technical errors um and obviously the device hacks reasonably
18:13
regularly um then this protects your principal um against um against that so
18:18
if there's a hack and you lose your principle then you can get um a claim payment um and so the kind of more technical
18:25
difference between like protocol cover or yield token cover um protocol color is a very like um i described one of
18:32
them as horizontal and one of them is vertical so protocol cover is horizontal for a particular protocol so for example
18:38
with curve you can put your money in a whole bunch of different tools within curve um uscc or a whole bunch of
18:45
different ones and um and so with protocol cover your cover against any issue in curve across all pools
18:54
with yield token cover this is like vertical coverage for def like full stack coverage for d5 so
19:01
on partic like often with indeed fire you've got composability and so uh some protocols are built on top of other
19:07
protocols build on top of other protocols etc and you get this stacked risk um and so if you were to get full
19:12
coverage for using protocol cover you'd have to buy five different coverages or something to get um coverage so um that
19:18
obviously doesn't work so well um so we have yield token cover for that which is basically for a specific yield bearing
19:25
token enter your token cover um for a specific position you can get full stack
19:30
coverage against um the particular risk and that covers any protocol that's in the stack
19:37
um including potential d-pegs of like a usdt or something if that's in the in the stack um and so
19:44
that's kind of comprehensive cover um and it's quite an elegant mechanism actually um you can basically gives you
19:49
the right to swap your yield bearing token for 90 cents worth of die or 90 worth of
19:57
eighth um so you can always get to back to 90 of the underlying asset so if something in the stack breaks i mean
20:03
your yield token is no longer worth the one dollar um that you thought it was supposed to be worth um then you can
20:10
get back to 90 cents and so um yeah so those are the main those are the main products we have right now um
20:16
so yeah so two for the d5 system and one for the kind of c5 system so in terms of the number of claims that
Paid Out Claims
20:23
you've received where is that at and do you expect going into the future as more
20:28
and more people like adoption increases in the d5 and and crypto space do you
20:33
expect the claim numbers to go up over time yeah i mean i definitely expected the
20:38
numbers to go up over time mainly because of just we're growing and then we're covering more stuff and so there's more going to be more hacks etc you know
20:45
more people impacted but um and that's really more of an adoption thing more than anything else um but um so in terms
20:52
of the claims we've paid so we paid from three major events um the bzx hack for
20:58
about two and a half years ago um if i forgot my topic right um maybe that was 18 months ago um the yearn hack from
21:05
earlier this year um only a couple of weeks ago we paid for the cream um hacks
21:10
um so um those are the three main claim events we've paid out for um there's only been one claim event that
21:16
we haven't paid out for um and that's that was make it ours black thursday event um
21:22
and um that was that was because the smart contract still worked but it was due to the
21:28
the bots or the um people making actually bids for that collateral that they didn't work um and
21:34
as a result of that we actually expanded the wording of the coverage to actually include events like that in the future so it was a bit of a learning for us
21:40
that you know our original policy wasn't quite as wide as we thought it was new risks come up in
21:46
crypto all the time um so we took that as learning and expanded the coverage and as a result of that and clearly pay
21:51
down on the korean hacks and the year hacks so um so that was interesting um yeah so yeah that's our main event the
21:57
main events we've had so far but yeah i mean i guess the other kind of question to that do do i think risks levels are
22:04
reducing or increasing in general perhaps more what you're getting at um
22:10
in general things should harden and risk should reduce as the as the protocols become more battle tested
22:16
but i guess um three main events recently um are quite interesting
22:23
one being um so compound had an issue with their comp rewards um where
22:30
their their governance updated their contracts and it introduced a bug
22:35
and so the underlying compound protocol was was fine but the rewards got basically some people would claim lots
22:41
of rewards and other people couldn't claim very much um but the the wider point there was um even though lots of
22:46
people looked at it had audits and all the rest of it it still it introduced a bug into a very
22:52
stable protocol um just because there's governance and the ability to update so that was kind of one thing um another
22:57
thing more recently was um samsung found a bug in sushi um it wasn't exploited or
23:04
anything but um so it's a white white hat and it patched it and everything could have been 300 million or something
23:10
um but um but sushi had actually undergone formal verification which is mathematically proving that um that
23:17
there's no bug but the problem with that is that it's not actually a silver bullet because
23:22
you have to construct a list of this is what we're testing against and the thing that right
23:28
the list didn't include that the potential vulnerabilities so um so that was another learning um and the third
23:34
one was are they um so are they actually had the same vulnerability as cream
23:39
um but it couldn't be exploited because just the economics didn't quite
23:45
work um so the you know because you had to do some really tricky stuff and push the prices of the particular assets to
23:52
extremes and and thought it worked for cream just because of the proportional
23:57
um exposures to different assets but that wasn't the case for ave and so how they had to patch it um in an emergency
24:04
fashion in three days but they can only do it in three days because there was a time lock um and so but the point being
24:10
that everyone thinks are they really secure um but the point that they did have a bug effectively a
24:17
bug as well so um i guess those three events have made me realize that yeah i
24:23
think the overall trend for risk should be down but i don't think it's ever really fully going away off do you realize our
24:29
audience has been either watching or listening to this episode for 20 minutes 20 minutes
24:35
no they should probably subscribe yeah they should subscribe and if you're watching on youtube make sure you
24:40
comment and turn on notifications and if you're listening to this podcast especially if you're on apple podcast
24:46
leave us a rating and a review we're also on twitter instagram and even tick talk so go check
24:52
out the episode description you can find all that information below and we have an update on the nft don't we that's
24:58
right we didn't previously mention this but this nft for og supporter is a one
25:04
of one there will only be one of this kind ever minted and we have a few surprises for the person who purchases
25:10
it the link is in the episode description and back to the episode so
Hugh's Blockchain Learning Curve
25:16
uh you know with all those stories of um recent bugs and hacks
25:22
in your world um you know initially i might think oh pay attention
25:28
to the insurance landscape but it really seems like you have to pay a lot of attention to
25:34
you know the hack landscape and the things that ultimately result in paying people out who have this
25:40
insurance uh personally uh for you has this helped you to really learn a lot more
25:47
about general blockchain security yeah i've been on a personal state
25:52
learning curve because you know i mean by no means a security expert but just being deeply involved in this type of
25:59
stuff um it's yeah it's really eye-opening i guess one thing that gives me a lot of um
26:05
comfort and i guess i'm really positive about is whenever something happens there is there are war rooms that get
26:11
set up behind the scenes that are cross protocol all the experts jump in and help each other out and
26:17
that that often doesn't come out um in public a lot like you see inklings of it on twitter maybe but but there's there's
26:24
there's a really strong group of security experts that all dive in and some things um impacted and they really
26:30
do help each other out um and get to resolutions as quickly as possible and that gives me a lot of confidence as a
26:35
broader community that um you know one we're focused on the right stuff
26:41
and two that when something like this happens um we can we can fix it and everyone's
26:46
focused on actually making sure it doesn't happen again as far as possible um and so you know taking those
26:52
learnings um from an open community and then applying them throughout the community um that's
26:58
only going to make us stronger over time and one of the things you just recently mentioned is like some of the the i
Why Some Claims Were Not Covered
27:04
think you mentioned four big events um where three of the four were covered i looked at your
27:11
like the list of all the um claim submissions and
27:17
and i did a quick count so this might not be totally accurate but uh i think it was around 80 there was around 100
27:24
claims over the last two two and a half years and of those claims
27:30
80 of them had been denied and 20 had been accepted um but
27:36
as far as i understand it those are like individual claims so why is that that that 80 were denied 20 were accepted and
27:43
do you think that 80 20 split will probably kind of continue on as well
27:49
um no i mean to be honest the vast majority of those 80 claims that are being denied are actually just people testing the system with it from an
27:54
integration point of view so a lot of them are just for like it covers that someone bought for one ease so that they
28:00
could test the integration from replacement so of course they get too high yeah um so um the only material
28:06
like the only functional ones that are actually denied are the maker ones the rest have been approved they have ac there's actually there i see one there
28:12
for i think it was uni swap um so someone submitted a claim for uni swap and tried and voted yes on their own
28:18
claim and then they were um out voted by other people other members and the claim was denied but there's
28:23
clearly no issue with uniform like people there are a bunch of people that um submit speculative claims and if we're like you know the right thing to
28:31
do is deny them otherwise the whole product is unsustainable so you know it's an open system that anyone can do what they want but that also means that
28:37
we have to deny the test claims or the speculative ones where clearly nothing has happened so yeah yeah and that
Why $NXM Holders Approve Legit Claims
28:44
that's an interesting uh point like wade and i were talking because you know we only know so much about how this stuff
28:50
works and uh we're thinking like okay well do the
28:55
like how does that part work the someone makes a claim and then
29:00
it's holders of the nxm token and they
29:06
get to it's like a governance style token they get to then place their votes on whether um a claim is accepted or
29:13
denied you know how does that all work and is there a worry at all about
29:19
you know like why are they incentivized to do the right thing in yeah yeah so there's an obvious there's an obvious
29:24
like why would they ever vote to pay their claims right um yeah um so so the key thing here is that um the
29:33
mutual like if you just step way back from an incentive point of view from a pure if you're just talking
29:39
really really short term um then you would decline all claims because that gives you the most value in the short
29:45
term but that destroys the mutual because then the mutual has no value so from a long-term point of view you're really
29:51
destroying a lot of value like if if you decline legitimate claims then the mutual should shut down it has no reason
29:56
to exist um and so that that's the kind of core mechanics that we're that we're using here if you vote on claims then you must
30:03
lock your tokens up for a decent period of time and therefore you're exposed to
30:08
the longer term performance of the mutual and therefore your interests are more aligned to
30:13
paying general claims the second point is um there is a function if you're clearly attacking the
30:20
system whether that's voting and declining clearly legit claims or decline
30:26
approving speculative ones then you can have your stake burned
30:32
and so there's a direct disincentive and so we have actually burned someone um from that person who
30:38
voted except on their own claim when there was clearly nothing going on um and so that um
30:44
that that's that's that's functioning how it works um i guess from my perspective i guess
30:50
we've done quite a few things one um we did a lot of work on this in terms of the design um secondly before we launched it we
30:58
actually attached this thing with ai agents that were trained with machine learning techniques and they could bribe
31:05
each other out of band to try and extract money from the system um and we had to make some adjustments on like the
31:12
thresholds and things like that but the overall mechanism held up to that level of attack um and so it basically
31:20
approved all of the genuine claims and declined all of the um ones so you know that's that's a simulation that's not
31:26
real life so you know who knows actually what's going to happen but um point being we've done a lot of work on this
31:32
um and because it's it's called what the mutual is trying to do if it doesn't make genuine claims it's no point um so
31:37
yeah i mean if you have a look in our claims discussion channels whenever a hack comes in everyone's like how can we pay this claim how can we make it work
31:44
because you know this is what we're here for to do this this is our moment to shine you know um so yeah but i mean
31:50
it's a fair question it's obviously an obvious question and people are concerned about it and yeah i mean because insurance companies never
31:56
pay right um so that's the thing well i think yeah that makes so much sense and you know we've we've had
32:03
different discussions on this show from everything from you know nfts to specific coins and projects and one of
32:08
the themes is just reputation right like long-term reputation is everything so to your point it's so important that you're
32:15
functioning properly or else no one will will use the protocol what one thing i'm curious about
Will Nexus Offer IRL Insurance
32:21
will blockchain technology ever or like nexus mutual will that ever
32:26
merge into the real world or real life in the sense of like you know things like home
32:32
insurance car insurance like do you see that happening in the future
32:38
yeah i do um maybe not those particular lines but um but definitely more kind of real
32:44
world like non-crypto stuff um so one one thing that's probably more
32:50
closely than you might think is something like weather um druids or natural catastrophe type stuff where you
32:56
know it's a bit easier to assess claims on a remote basis that you don't have to go on to the mechanic and say oh yeah
33:02
the car was damaged or it has to be written off or whatever here you can have uh was there an earthquake
33:08
at this location of this magnitude or whatever payout a claim so um but the products have to be right um
33:14
for the particular setup that we've got at the moment um and i don't necessarily see us going into very
33:20
hyper competitive markets like auto or whatever um to start well at least to
33:25
start with or not for a very long time i say it's more playing within niche or underserved markets where there's
33:32
capacity constraints or people can't get cover that's one of the things that's worked really well for us like you can't
33:37
get crypto cover from traditional insurers so people come to us um
33:43
and and you know like we're new and not as proven as a 100 year old
33:48
insurance company but you know that doesn't matter so much when you're the only option so you know um
33:55
the point being is we're more likely to find traction in more niche markets to start with but definitely looking at things like weather derivatives um
34:02
also potentially some like liability or legal expense type cover for
34:08
crypto people that operate that work for dows or all those types of things so you know that's kind of still kind of within
34:13
crypto but it's also real worldly type stuff like if you get sued or something like that so you know
34:19
early stages on some of that stuff but definitely looking to expand and i think that's one of the benefits of nexus's model because we have this
34:26
kind of voting on the claims assessment it we can actually write any product um like the product doesn't have to be
34:33
absolutely coded up you can have people interpret a word document of what actually is the
34:40
definition of a claim so you've got ultimate flexibility in the product design and so uh like to that point maybe this
34:48
you just basically answered this question but is there anything that's on the roadmap today beyond just some
34:53
future ideas that you just mentioned you know are there specifics um sort of products that are in the works or that
35:00
are to be launched soon that you're able to share with us yeah we've got um the the liability and
35:06
legal expense one is one we have been working out for a little bit um it's probably one of the more challenging
35:11
ones to do in a decentralized fashion but um but that's something that i
35:16
wouldn't say is necessarily imminent because i know we have got some you know issues or challenges to work through but i'm confident we'll get there um then we
35:24
do have some other more crypto native ones that can't show the exact details right now but um but
35:30
within the crypto sphere that that could be quite they're quite big um and uncover some big risks that um that
35:36
currently you very can't get cover for um regularly so um and i have made
35:42
public that we are working with a particular partner on potentially writing a weather derivative um from
35:48
them um which would be really cool i mean probably the biggest barrier there is um
35:54
their compliance department getting okay with dealing with the crypto version of the insurance company but um if we get over that hurdle then
36:00
um that would be pretty amazing yeah no kidding that's awesome so as we understand it 2019 was a bit of
Hugh's Perseverance in 2019
36:07
a difficult time for you um you had to take out a personal loan even lay people off to keep nexus mutual afloat uh so
36:15
can you tell us a little bit about that experience and and how you got through it
36:20
yeah um it turns out i'm super stubborn um so that's probably how i got through it to
36:26
be honest um but yeah i think we we got to a point like that was kind of like deep bear market um we we raised um
36:35
mostly around we our original kind of seed round was in e and um i perhaps similarly didn't sell
36:42
all of it um for us dollars at the time um and so kind of wrote down the the the
36:49
bear market um and so that meant you know shorten that runway and you know development took a bit longer than expected and so we ended up in a really
36:55
quite difficult position um but managed to um yeah managed to cut it back to a
37:01
really kind of core team to try and get to launch and i think ultimately this was personally i was just like got so close
37:08
and i just wanted to see it launched if it launched and no one used it i'd be like okay fine you know uh it didn't
37:13
work okay that's that's all right but um if we had to give up before we actually launched it i was going i never really
37:19
know um so yeah i guess i um stubbornness kicked in and um basically
37:25
took the only route that um i had available to me get rid of everyone but the core to get it over the line um
37:32
and then take out a bit of a loan against the crypto i had left and um yeah we just got over the line
37:38
raised more running after that and yeah it's been it's been um yeah i guess we've been riding the waves since then
37:43
so it's been really great so with that experience in mind i mean we talk a lot about this on the show but the the
37:49
concept of four-year cycles and that type of thing and if we are to hit another bear market like we experienced
37:55
from 2018 to 2020 do you think your nexus mutual now
38:00
you're in a good spot you're gonna be okay yeah yeah for sure i know how to know how to manage through
38:06
that now um bit hindsight's not wonderful i guess um but yeah i guess it's very you know make
38:12
sure you've got enough room way to make it through um basically at all times and we kind of touched on the the usage
Purpose of $NXM Tokens
38:19
of nxm tokens can you is there anything to expand on that like why would someone want to hold
38:25
being an xm holder yeah so what you become a member of the mutual and then you can obviously
38:31
hold that exam if you wish um and you can do a whole bunch of things with it one i guess you can buy cover with it
38:39
most people buy cover with each or die and basically ignore the ending that's fine um but you can buy cover
38:45
with it um but then i guess the main functions are really the claims assessment as i discussed but then the
38:50
staking which is kind of like the pricing or the underwriting and so um nexus
38:56
members basically optionally stake against risks that they think are good risks and the more people
39:02
that stakes the lower the price of that cover and the more capacity is offered on that particular risk so the mutual as
39:08
a whole is happier to write more business on that particular risk because lots of people back it so it's basically crowdsourced pricing or underwriting um
39:16
which is interesting in and of itself because no one has ever really done that before um but um but it's actually worked
39:22
really well for us because it's kind of saying conceptually that the community that's closest to the risk are the
39:28
people that are best placed to assess the risk um and so i fundamentally
39:33
believe that that's the case and you know in d5 like well insurance companies just generally rely on masses of
39:39
historical data to price but d5 doesn't have any history like in like there's
39:44
like a couple of years worth basically and how many hacks have there been quite a few but at the time when we launched a
39:50
cup two or three um and so there's no real historic data to price anything but what we do have is
39:57
expertise in people that are deep in the community and so we're essentially using that and we think that's a much more flexible way of
40:04
of pricing um but but also i don't think it i think it's fundamentally quite um powerful one interesting
40:11
anecdote i guess is that when bsc launched and started launching a
40:17
whole bunch of d5 protocols on finance smart chain we started listing those for cover and
40:24
not many of our community decided to stake on them um and so no basically very few people
40:30
if any of you was only a handful of cover buyers as a result because the prices were so high and then a bunch of them got hacked
40:36
and so you know maybe the model isn't perfect but like directionally that's that's a pretty good signal but it's
Nexus's Competitors
40:43
it's working okay and what about um competitors you know you mentioned that
40:48
when you were starting this you had this concept no one had done it is that still the case today or are there now other um you
40:56
know decentralized mutual style
41:01
blockchain yeah there are definitely a few different ones out there various forms
41:07
um i think we still like we still dominate that the vertical which i think is quite different to
41:13
other um verticals within d5 um like you know with lending you kind of make a compound
41:19
out of it like you've got multiple b really big players with dexes you've got okay if you need some hobbies sushi swap
41:24
play you know there's there are big ones out there um and multiple ones um in insurance
41:30
relatively compared to d5 it's still relatively small like compared to
41:35
um like traditional um finance like the banks and the insurance companies you know there and
41:41
thereabouts whereas here we've got the banks of the fire much bigger than the insurance companies
41:47
um and i personally think that's because insurance is probably an order of magnitude more complicated to get
41:54
right um technically um you've got to do a lot of balance you got to is the pricing balanced is the claims
42:00
assessment balance it's not um it's harder to programmatically do these types of things um and so i guess it's
42:06
still learning and there's still um um you know it's a bit harder to do so you know that's a bit more challenging so
42:12
there are definitely other competitors but we're still dominating the the vertical at the moment um you know
42:18
there's definitely room for several large competitors like it's a massive opportunity um so we don't tend
42:24
to focus on competitors too much we just tend to focus on delivering what we um can and grabbing the massive pie that's
KYC Requirements
42:31
in front of us i was listening to another interview you were on and you were getting some
42:36
questions about why users are required to use or to to input kyc know your customer is that
42:43
does that still exist or has that been removed or where is the process at um yeah so we still require kyc um
42:50
that's one of the i guess one of the differences about nexus um i can give you a little bit of
42:55
background on that so i mean one of the things is that next is when you join and become a member of nexus you actually become a member of a legal company
43:02
in the uk um nexus mutual limited um it runs as a discussion eventually in the
43:07
uk and essentially it's bought all of its functions are automated using the smart contracts on ethereum so it's a
43:13
legally linked dow or something like that you know there are multiple terms but that's what um that's kind of how it works which is quite unique um within
43:20
the space um we did that primarily because it gave us a lot of clarity from
43:25
a legal and regulatory point of view when there was virtually none um at the time um and the fact that we have that
43:32
legal entity means we have to kyc um people so that's kind of where it comes from
43:38
there is a big discussion within the community about um dissolving the legal entity surrounding nexus mutual um and
43:46
then potentially going to a full stateless down um so we're just doing the required legal tax accounting type
43:53
work behind that um at the moment and hopefully by the end of the year we'll be putting up a um
43:59
a proposed path of execution um based on the analysis work that's been done
44:05
and funded out of the community and then it's up to the community to decide whether they want to take that forward or not
How Hugh's Metamask was Hacked
44:11
that makes sense you were getting close to the end of the conversation but before we get into kind of the last
44:16
section of questions that we ask every guest i want to switch gears and ask you about something and i saw an episode of
44:23
bankless where you're talking about the fact that your meta mask was hacked and it seemed like to me that was it this
44:30
i hadn't heard of a situation like that like it seemed quite intricate how they they went about it do you mind sharing that story i mean there's a podcast that
44:37
tries to educate people new to the space uh we're always talking about the importance of of security and all of
44:43
that kind of thing so do you mind sharing that experience with our audience yeah it was a um a pretty scary episode
44:49
to be honest but um yeah i know happy to share because hopefully people can learn from it um so to give you an idea i
44:56
i use i personally use um so this was a personal attack on me um not nexus as
45:01
the whole of my personal holdings and i use a hardware wallet connected
45:08
through metamask so what happened was i was a targeted
45:13
phishing attack where my cto's email was spoofed they sent me
45:18
a docx file via email which essentially had malware in it um
45:24
and but i guess one of the interesting points was the topic of the of the
45:29
document was something we were discussing that day um and so they monitor the discord telegram chats
45:36
to craft the um documents et cetera anyway so once i'm on a windows machine
45:43
i was on a windows machine at the time um so open up the file at that point
45:48
they've got full access to my computer um they've exploited a windows vulnerability somewhere um and so they
45:55
have access to my computer um they haven't got access to my private keys because they're on the hardware
46:01
wallet but they've got full access to the computer i'm talking about
46:06
two to three months between that point and the actual execution of the attack
46:12
um so they specifically crafted the attack for me so what they did was they
46:17
um i went when i was going to claim some rewards so do something i guess pretty innocuous within d5 um
46:24
metamask came up and says yeah you're claiming the rewards but what it's um what it's actually doing has replaced
46:31
that underneath with um send them a lot of nxm
46:36
um so metamask just shows you're doing what you expect to be doing then it pushes a the transaction to your
46:42
hardware wallet um and your hardware wallet just shows hex data that you can't actually
46:48
interpret as a human and so you just click through and go a proof and so what i'd done there was
46:54
effectively um unapproved sending them a lot of money so my private keys were never hacked but they tricked me into sending them a
47:00
lot of money by spoofing the transaction um and so and i'm the only one that
47:05
could ever do that transaction so the point being that it was specifically crafted
47:10
for me so i guess it was probably you know highly targeted from the rest of that but the but the interesting point
47:16
there is like um if even if your computer's compromised
47:22
you can still be and you're on a hardware wallet you can still be tricked because yeah um
47:27
unless you really read the hex data then what are you supposed to do and that's really really challenging like no one is
47:33
should be expected to be able to do that um you know so that's quite a challenging thing um in terms of what i
47:39
do now is probably hopefully of interest um i don't use a windows machine um i
47:44
also have a separate machine that just signs transactions doesn't do any social
47:51
email nothing else um so just it's very focused and then i have a different machine the way you stay today
47:57
and so that that minimizes risk it's not foolproof and all the rest of it um the other thing i do is i make sure i check
48:03
the two address of every contract interaction so i'm doing stupid things like whenever i
48:08
sign a transaction copy it go into either scan look it up and say yeah is that actually like you swap or
48:14
compounding whatever i'm doing um and before um before sitting approved so
48:20
it's painful but necessary it's crazy to think about that and just in general like the the level of work
48:26
and like specifically targeting you and going through that but i think that's a good message is regardless i mean the
48:33
average listener um to this podcast probably you know isn't going to be targeted like
48:38
that however there are you know even if it's a dm on discord some of these look very legit and if you're new to the
48:45
space it can be yeah it can be a scary place sometimes so really good i'm glad you shared that
48:50
and hugh in general you've done a an awesome job just explaining everything uh you know like i said at the top we're
48:57
we're not overly versed in in insurance but everything you said was completely understandable we like to end every
49:03
episode of show me the crypto the same three question segment we call it you had me at crypto and elf's gonna ask you
49:10
those questions all right here you ready i'm ready first
Who Hugh Follows
49:16
question is who is your favorite person to follow in the crypto space
49:22
oh that's a good one i've got a lot um i like i really like frank casu um i
49:28
think his balance takes um and very well researched takes a um a pretty up there
49:33
um with yeah and then there's a whole bunch of [ __ ] posters that are also coming forward but um but yeah for quality uh
BTC Price in 10 Years
49:40
is probably a good one cool second question is what will the price of bitcoin be 10 years from now
49:47
i honestly have no idea i i worry that bitcoin's got a security
49:52
budget problem and it could crash but within 10 years it probably still goes
49:58
up so you know it could be a lot higher than it is now i have no idea hundreds of
Underrated Crypto Project
50:03
thousands of people all right and third question what is the most underrated coin or project in
50:09
crypto other than nxm rather than nexus yeah um yeah that's a that's a good question
50:16
there's a lot of stuff going on now that's um i don't know i don't think adds a lot of fundamental value um but but um but
50:23
there is some really cool stuff up there i i like liquidy and uh reflexer um which are like you
50:30
know more very like new like stable coins but they're a really competitive censorship resistant because i think
50:36
that could be very powerful in the future um you know um most people are using usdc etc now but
50:42
um who knows how the regulatory actions change and so i think a place for really
50:48
highly censorship resistant stable coins is needed good stuff well thank you so much hugh
50:53
