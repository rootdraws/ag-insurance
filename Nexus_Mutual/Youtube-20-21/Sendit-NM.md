Introduction to Nexus Mutual and DeFi Insurance
0:00
[Music] hello guys welcome back to another
0:05
episode of send it uh today I'm joined by myself of course W uh we've got my
0:11
co-host the advisor today this time I've decided to do the intro normally it's him but I decided to uh take the honors
0:18
uh and we're joined by our lovely lovely guest today Brave New defi who's from Nexus Mutual a real pleasure to have him
0:24
today how are both of you today yeah I'm doing well it's good to
0:29
be here nice to have you on man and nice to have you doing the intro W to be honest probably probably a Better
0:37
Business decision on our side no no no no no don't say that don't say that anyway um I'm super glad to have next
0:43
Mutual because um it's a it's a protocol that isn't really like the protocols that we've had on our show before I mean
0:51
we've predominantly been talking about defi protocols uh and kind of some of them are lending Market some of them
0:57
money market some of them uh Perpetual exchanges kind of very hardcore defi stuff that we've had um and now we're
1:03
kind of looking taking a step back and kind of thinking about how we can protect against that uh and so uh I
1:09
think Nexus plays a real like can play a a real crucial role in how defi uh
1:17
evolves from here and so that's hopefully what we're going to learn about today not only myself and the advisor uh but also I think the viewers
1:24
that we have today as well so yeah would love to uh first of all learn about what actually is Nexus and kind of what is it
1:30
doing in the defi space today yeah absolutely um yeah Nexus Mutual for those of you who don't know
1:36
is a decentralized insurance alternative um and we use a community based approach to to sharing risk so everybody who
1:43
joins the mutual can contribute eth they can hold nxm they can buy cover they can underwrite cover they can participate in
1:49
governance you can pretty much as a member participate in in every level of the mutual and so this is a more
Understanding Nexus Mutual's Community-Based Model
1:56
community-minded model uh that was very common before you know the of like big traditional Insurance where people came
2:03
together they shared risk and when somebody incurred a loss people would work together to to make those folks whole and so it's kind of this uh it's a
2:10
discretionary Mutual model which is also a very common model that's used by a lot of other um people acting in traditional
2:17
insurance as well like you know people are familiar with the different mutuals um so yeah it's kind of returning back
2:22
to this community- based model and a way from like separating out the Actuarial work the underwriting work and the
2:29
assessment away from the people that are actually buying cover so uh yeah I mean
2:36
that's that's essentially the model that we're using what Nexus actually does is um we've primarily been underwriting
2:43
cover for risks and defi so risks on chain our most popular product that's
2:49
been around the longest is protocol cover which is protection against smart
2:54
contract risk so when you're deploying funds in defi let's say you're depositing an a you're depositing in Cur
3:00
you know you're depositing in some def5 protocol you are exposed to Smart contract risk whether that is the um
3:06
threat of a hack the threat of there being some flaw in the economic design where somebody can go in and uh
3:13
manipulate prices on an Oracle and withdraw all of the the money from a lending Market or you know um one of the
3:21
more common vectors that we've seen over the last like three or four years has been re-entrancy attacks where somebody
3:26
can go in and essentially they can Loop a function and they can exploit out the funds that are held in a contract so
3:34
we've seen a lot of losses I think it's been around seven or eight billion dollars worth of losses here in the last three years or so and it's something
3:41
that definitely holds us back from from wider adoption and it's the thing I think most people outside of defi
3:48
associate with crypto they associate crypto with either making a lot of money or losing a lot of money which is not a
3:54
great Public Image for us but if we want more people to participate on Shane you need some kind of coverage model so
4:00
people can protect themselves against these risks and there just aren't many um there's not really many traditional
4:06
insurers that are willing to underwrite that risk for the average user and there's really not a lot of people underwriting risk in this sector in in
4:14
the first place so that's one of the reasons why the mutual was established in
4:20
2019 yeah I mean it makes sense I think one of the things that we do see a lot in defi today is is quite unfortunate
4:26
but even today we do still see exploits week after week uh some of them big some of them small but it can affect anyone
4:34
really um especially when you're trying to use some of these more Innovative uh newer protocols you could say um but I
4:41
think we've even seen that in the past even bigger protocols have been exploited um I think one of the ones
4:47
that really stands out to me uh last year was the the oiler exploit um and I
4:52
think uh Nexus has been involved with that in a good way actually um I'd love
4:58
to I'd love to learn more from yourself kind of about the different products and kind of which protocols you Ure and kind
5:05
of how that all works exactly especially from a from a user perspective let's say you're you're someone like me who loves
5:10
to be a little bit Dean and use some of these different protocols uh you do like to provide collateral and things like
5:16
that how how does a user even get insurance in the first place yeah so I one thing I'll I'll set
5:23
out and say too is that people often use the word insurance with Nexus but we are discretionary Mutual so we offer
5:29
discretion cover which is not Insurance um just just to be specific there on the
How to Buy Cover and Protect Against Risks
5:34
difference between those two insurance is something that's heavily regulated in different ways all over the world so
5:41
with a discretionary Mutual model again is you're joining the mutual and you're sharing risk with other people so you
5:46
can as a member of the mutual you can buy cover so at the end of the day members of the mutual have final say on
5:51
which claims get paid well we have that cover wording agreement and the claims assessment process follows the line that
5:57
these are the cover terms and if there is a loss according to to the cover terms outlined for each individual
6:02
product that members should pay a claim historically we've paid out claims where
6:07
losses have been verified and fit the wording even in some cases there have been things that weren't technically
6:14
covered by the cover wording but members use their discretion in a positive way and still paid those claims so the
6:20
difference is why someone is paying a claim and insurer has a legal obligation to make a
6:25
claim as a discretionary Mutual we can make a choice and we can even use that discretion to pay out when the wording
6:31
says otherwise so um you're trusting the economic model and the fraud prevention
6:37
mechanisms within the mutual to align incentives so that people pay claims because at the end of the day if the
6:42
mutual didn't pay claims nobody would buy cover nobody would use us people would leave the mutual and the whole
6:48
thing would go bust so that being said um how do people
6:54
buy cover and how do people protect themselves against risk typically what we see right now is people are deploying
7:01
funds into protocols and then they're coming to us to buy cover there's a lot of funds that are buying cover there's a
7:06
lot of higher netw worth individuals that are buying cover with some of the people building on top of Nexus like
7:12
open cover we have more retail members uh like retail users that are buying cover and they're coming to us through
7:20
that distributor open cover and they're active on base arbitrum and optimism so people find us one way or another and
7:27
then they come and they buy protection they come into the app if you're buying cover or open cover you can just go
7:32
choose the coverage that you want you choose the amount of cover that you want either denominated in die or eth so if
7:38
you do have a claim to file you're going to get your payout in whatever the cover is denominated then a lot of people like
7:44
if they're using Pendle to earn on liquid reaking tokens they're going to get eth nominated cover so if eth goes
7:50
up or down in price it doesn't matter because one eth is always one eth people that are earning in Stables typically
7:55
buy die denominated covers and then you select the period of time that you want to be covered for and that's you know
8:01
the active cover period um so that's how people are coming and buying cover the risk that they're protecting themselves
8:07
against again there are two core types of risk within defi if you break them into two different categories one is the
8:14
technical side and one is the economic side on the technical side you have the smart contracts themselves so can
8:21
somebody come in and exploit a flaw within the contract is there um some math error is there a logic error that
8:27
allows somebody to exploit a fun function uh is there a reentrancy error which we've seen again a lot of um is
8:35
there something within the contracts that's flawed that somebody can manipulate to be able to steal funds from the protocol the economic side is
8:42
let's say um you know we were talking about this earlier for make or Dow black
8:47
Thursday you had an event where uh prices move very quickly and oracles
8:54
were updating but Keepers uh weren't very active because gas prices were very high and so the keepers that are
9:00
liquidating these Lots within maker are submitting bids and their goal is to submit the lowest bid so they can make
9:07
the most money when competition doesn't really exist people can submit very low bids they can make a lot of money um and
9:14
they can liquidate these Lots there wasn't protection in there that prevented people from bidding like at zero die so people were bidding and
9:21
saying I will give you zero die and I will liquidate this lot so they were creating bad debt through these
9:26
liquidations because there was no competition this isn't really a smart contract failure this is just a design
9:31
failure and so at the time we didn't cover that risk after that it became clear that oh this is a risk that we
9:37
didn't anticipate so members went back to the drawing board revised the wording um and then now we have that in in the
9:44
mutual so if there's severe liquidation failure that leads to a loss that's covered under protocol cover uh in the
9:50
case of bad debt acre in a lending Market again if there's severe liquidation failures we cover that
9:56
another thing that we cover that a lot of people don't cover is Oracle risk so if someone's able to manipulate an
10:01
Oracle and move the price so they can exploit a lending Market or they can you know exploit an Oracle and some other
10:07
Market that creates a loss for users that's also something we cover um the more unlikely risk is if somebody
Types of Risks Covered by Nexus Mutual
10:13
goes in and actually like uh corrupts in Oracle so they like manipulate the actual data feed that's a lot less
10:20
common it's more of people manipulating prices that can move an oracle outside of the standard bounds within the market
10:26
um this happens if people are using centralized oracles we saw that in 2020
10:32
in November around Thanksgiving with compound because at the time compound was using coinbase as their primary market for die low liquidity in that
10:39
market people were buying up die die went up in price lots of people got liquidated when they shouldn't have um
10:44
and then that created issues with within compound so you know there's a lot of these different examples if you look
10:49
back in defi a lot of the products that we've made we've updated over time to reflect those risks and to better adapt
10:55
to those risks because ultimately that's what people want when they're buying cover yeah no thank you for that it's really
11:01
interesting just to hear about the different types of uh ele or the different elements that you actually
11:07
cover like I found the Oracle one really interesting because um I think we did see uh uh some Oracle attacks happening
11:16
you know maybe in the bare Market I remember the mango Market Oracle attack uh I'm not sure if you guys were
11:22
covering manga markets you know we mentioned it on the show today actually the oh yeah didn't
11:29
because we were talking about some uh like the the storm legal case and some
11:34
of the Unis swap stuff and some other like stuff about how to actually regulate uh like the industry what's
11:41
fair what's legal uh and all that stuff and that uh topic came out as well and
11:48
actually very interesting to hear what brai has to say about like incident
11:54
incidences like these and like uh how uh something like next Nexus Mutual can uh
12:01
be at the service of like people in the future in similar situations yeah so um for mango we
12:09
didn't cover mango because mango I believe is on salana and we don't cover salana because we we offer coverage for
12:14
evm compatible networks um salana wouldn't be included in that but there have been cases uh where we have covered
12:21
that so like one example I have that's similar is like the the cream exploit from 2021 right it was October in 2021
12:30
and an attacker came in a very sophisticated attacker um and they essentially they manipulated an oracle
Real-World Exploits and Nexus Mutual's Response
12:36
that was being used in the cream markets and cream was a compound V2 Fork uh they had longer tale Assets in their markets
12:43
one of which were these urine Vault tokens and the Oracle they were using was the actual urine Vault itself and so
12:50
what somebody was able to do is they deposited those urine Vault tokens as collateral they borrowed against them
12:56
and they did something that most people wouldn't think about as instead of uh you know because that is the Oracle
13:02
Source right so how do you how do you manipulate that well what this person figured out is if I send money to that
13:08
Vault that I'm increasing the price per share of the Vault tokens that I hold
13:15
and if I have those in the lending market and I'm sending money directly there and I'm bumping up the price of
13:20
that then I can borrow more against this collateral and so through a few different vectors they were able to use
13:25
Flash loans to donate there they were borrowing and they essentially they borrowed all of the available liquidity
13:32
um within the lending market and they they did this and they pretty much stole all the funds that were on cream there
13:38
were very few funds that that weren't affected in this case and so now there's a lot of collateral that's worth a lot
13:44
of money um at the Smart contract level that's what the protocol thinks because this price has been inflated but
13:50
actually uh there's not really anything there there's not nearly enough to to cover all of the debt at one time I want
13:57
to say if I'm remembering this correctly there was like he manipulated the pricing so there was like $3.5 billion worth of collateral on
14:05
cream and then he borrowed like two billion or something I mean it was just
14:10
some crazy large number it was a very very sophisticated attack and uh that person or those people uh were you know
14:18
were never caught um so with that that was pretty much the end of cream cream
14:24
before then had been um like hacked a few times in much smaller circumstances
14:30
but that was kind of like the final blow and so there were a lot of people that were affected by that that was one that we paid out for um I think we paid out
14:36
something like 350 to 400,000 uh in claims for that there weren't a lot of
14:42
people that had cover for cream but the people that did they went through the claims process that was as um I had been
14:49
with the mutual at that point for six or eight months so that was my first claim event um and that was a very like eye
14:56
opening experience uh because yeah it's just heart ring I mean there were a lot of people there were people that like I had my life savings and cream and on the
15:04
one hand you want to be like why would you do that but on the other hand you have to feel for people because there's a lot of people that get involved in
15:09
this and depending on how you arrive at something if you read you know some influencers tweets that says this is all
15:15
safe it's FDIC insured you go in you lose money and then most people don't know what happens after a hack occurs so
15:22
I I usually around these like big loss events that we cover I try to put out a thread on like this is what happens like
15:28
you're not going to hear much from the team because they're trying to work to recover your funds or mitigate the vulnerabilities you know it's kind of
15:33
all hands- on Deck like they're in a war room um and information is like very valuable when an exploit is happening or
15:39
just after it's happened releasing a lot of details is not good because if you can negotiate with the attacker and get
15:45
money back which we've seen here in the last year there's been protocols that have been able to do that they've been able to identify who the person was and
15:52
basically say like if you don't give us the money back we will give your information over to the authorities and you will have a much worse time if you
15:59
give the money back you can keep a white hat Bounty um and you can basically walk away from this so you know we didn't see
16:06
a lot of that in 2020 or 2021 or 2022 so um you know things were quite a
16:12
bit different but uh most people after a hacka is they have no idea what happens and they're they're in at Discord they're asking questions and they get no
16:18
response because really the team can't say anything um so it's a very jarring experience and for some people it's like
16:25
you know one of the worst times in their lives if they've lost a significant amount of money yeah I can imagine it's
16:30
just such an intense emotion Rich time for everyone really who like the the users who have participated and lost
16:36
money uh but also like for you guys on the other teams who are involved in these War rooms trying to get whatever
16:44
they what whatever they can back I know um I think one of the notorious white
16:49
hack um white hackers is um is it Sam I think it's Sam he very yeah yeah yeah
16:57
yeah yeah yeah yeah um I I did actually listen to some of some of his podcasts and it was really interesting just to
17:04
learn about like what actually happens after an exploit and like like the process in order to kind of create a war
17:11
room and trying to negotiate and things like that it's so interesting yeah you know there's not um
17:17
I think people have been a bit more forthcoming here probably in like the last year but typically most people
17:23
people that are in war rooms don't talk about what they do in war rooms because again it's like information is like the
17:28
key the key thing that you have so unless you're in a war room there's not a lot of insight into what happens
17:33
within a war room but everybody in a war room is stressed like it is incredibly stressful the people the engineers that
17:39
work in those War rooms that try to mitigate losses you know like they're working all Hands-On deck it's a very
17:44
stressful time um but there's a lot of I I will say one thing that's really endearing about like the ethereum
17:50
community and just the engineers working in the space and general is when there's a loss people kind of come together uh
17:56
to try and like mitigate things to try and you know do good and we've even seen like Seal Seal uh
18:03
911 that has emerged which is now like the you know the um the security Collective like they've kind of come and
18:09
this is like a public good for the community for ethereum because this is something that we need to get to scale
18:15
we need to solve the security issues what's that again can you maybe uh share a bit about it I I don't think I uh yeah
18:22
it's um it's something Collective I I think it might be the security Collective but this was started by
18:28
Amazon and initially it was a group of people that were involved in war rooms pretty often and they formed this group
18:34
called uh clal 911 and this was basically like a telegram group where if
18:39
you were impacted by a hack you could go to them if you wanted to do like a war
18:44
room training like it they they would basically work with teams and simulate like here's what happens in an exploit
18:50
we're going to basically run the scenario um like there's an exploit and you guys have to respond so we can test
18:55
like your your um your response plan in the case of some kind of like critical vulnerability that gets exploited within
19:02
your protocol so they started doing this and they kind of scaled it up to an entire organization there's a lot of
19:07
great people in the space that have contributed to it and so again like this is essentially a public good um that's
19:13
come out of this and yeah I mean I know CL 911 has helped multiple protocols
19:19
that have been impacted and really help like mitigate losses in the event of an exploit so it's just been really great
19:26
to see things like that popping up so let's talk about um how we can actually uh not have these Dreadful
19:33
scenarios uh and how users can actually use Nexus right now so what are the exact protocols that you currently have
19:39
cover for um the list long list yeah uh so I
19:44
mean we we cover most of the major protocols so a compound um you know we cover Pendle we
Current Protocols Covered by Nexus Mutual
19:53
have these bundled covers that bundle things together we cover curve convex I mean we cover pretty much all of the
19:59
major protocols and there are other protocols that we cover as well but we have in total I think as of right now
20:05
like between all of our products like 160 some listings so there there's a lot
20:11
to go through um if if you go to the Nexus Mutual website you can kind of browse through what what some of those are but uh yeah we we offer cover for
20:18
all the major protocols we cover again smart contract exploits and hack Oracle failure manipulation um severe
20:26
liquidation failure that leads to a loss and then governance takeovers that that lead to a loss as well those are the
20:31
main things that we cover um and are these the are these always separate or
20:37
are there like bundles in which you can directly like get all uh like an all-in-one when you go to your when you
20:45
want to like purchase a specific insurance for whatever you're doing
20:50
um so I guess two things one is protocol cover protects against all those risks that I just listed but getting coverage
20:57
for multiple protocols typically before you had to buy like individual covers to protect against each protocol because
21:03
one protocol cover protects against loss within one protocol but recently here we launched bundled protocol cover which
21:10
bundles protocols together um into certain strategies so if people have like a certain strategy they want to buy
21:16
cover for uh if it's not listed they can come and they can contact us uh we have our product meetings every Wednesday we
21:23
can review that and we can get that listing up um and talk to the staking pool managers that are underwriting risk with the spe ecosystem and uh ask them
21:31
to underwrite it and then they can open up capacity set their own pricing and then you know that can become available so we've been pretty responsive when
21:37
people have asked for new products but yeah we do have bundle protocol cover the most popular ones we have right now are the the Pendle bundles so you can
21:44
buy cover for Igan layer ethery Pendle Igan layer Renzo Pendle I layer kelp
21:50
Pendle IG layer swell Pendle we have some of those we have a couple more that are coming this week too that have like
21:56
the the circuit um smart contract added as well so yeah when people request
22:01
these things we typically add them relatively quickly and then open up capacity and could you tell us about the
22:07
the costing for for these covers how does it work exactly yeah so uh previously in Nexus
Pricing and Cost Structure of Coverage
22:15
Mutual V1 things were quite a bit different but we shipped our V2 last year so V2 has been live for a year and
22:21
a month um and with V2 we have this staking pool model where people can
22:27
launch their own Stak pools and they can underwrite and manage risk uh if you're running a private pool then you're
22:32
running your own Capital if you're running a public pool you can put in your own Capital but people can also stake and delegate to you and so that
22:40
stake nxm correlates to Assets in the mutuals capital pool which is primarily
22:45
eth and that's what we use to underwrite risk so people who stake their nxm and underwrite risk are staking against
22:52
something they're opening up capacity and then they're setting their own pricing so they're saying I'll open up $100,000 worth of capacity for this risk
23:00
let's say it's um Pendle and then they're setting their own pricing so you
23:06
might have four or five different staking pools that are underwriting Pendle protocol
23:12
cover and the pricing is going to be different for all of them um but they have their minimum pricing that they set
23:18
that's the minimum pricing they'll accept to sell that risk and then there is dynamic pricing within the mutual so
23:25
if somebody comes in and let's say there's a bunch of people that come in in one day inside of like a couple hours and they're all buying Pendle protocol
23:32
cover what it's going to do is that Dynamic pricing is going to shift the price upward in each pool so if people
23:39
are buying cover from staking pool number one and there's a lot of Pendle covers going through it's going to move
23:44
that pricing up what the cover router within the mutual does is it spreads cover buys across pools and it's always
23:50
going to route you to the lowest priced pool for that specific cover so if you have four or five pools that are
23:56
underwriting risk as the cheapest one becomes more expensive because Dynamic pricing is Shifting things up it'll
24:02
shift you over to the cheapest pool and then once pricing goes up there it'll shift you over and if all of the pools
24:08
have basically sold cover now the price is going to be higher so if there is let's say a period of time where
24:14
everybody thinks oh no um you know like compound or or one of these protocols
24:20
just for example all of a sudden there's a lot more risk in this protocol so we all want to Pile in and buy cover Dy
24:26
Dynamic pricing shifts the price up so if the mutual is taking on a lot of risk in a short amount of time it kind of
24:32
controls supply and demand it also acts as a signal to the pool managers within the mutual to come and reassess that
24:38
risk maybe they want to provide more capacity which will also help keep the prices lower as people are buying cover
24:45
or maybe they want to like rate that risk and they want to increase their pricing and reduce some capacity on that
24:50
so that Dynamic pricing is is pretty important but it also spreads those cover buys across pools um but
24:56
ultimately pricing is set by pool manag ERS and each one of the pool managers is going to use like a different um pricing
25:02
methodology for for how they set pricing for protocols once uh just a quick question
User Experience and Buying Process for Coverage
25:08
on that once a your user has actually purchased uh cover let's say they let's say they purchased cover for one month
25:15
is the rate that they pay fixed for that duration yes yes uh so if you go in and
25:20
buy a cover for a month um again for something like pendall you're going to
25:25
go in you look at your cover you're going to put in the amount cover you want let's say it's 10 eth and you're
25:31
going to choose the time so you can buy cover for up to 365 days right for a year and the lowest amount of time you
25:37
can buy cover for is 28 days so with that you choose the time and based on
25:42
the amount of time that you want to buy cover and the amount of cover that you want to buy um you're going to get a
25:48
quote uh based on the available capacity and the pricing in the lowest price pool
25:53
once you buy cover that price is locked in um so you know you're going to pay whatever cover fee for that month you'll
26:00
pay your cost it's not like the price of that cover is going to go up while you're holding it like you're streaming a payment and the price goes up it's
26:06
locked in and that's really important for people that are buying cover because if they're you know putting money into a strategy and they're anticipating I'm
26:13
going to earn 20% cover is 3% they lock in that price if it were variable and it
26:18
shifted then all of a sudden you know halfway into your cover if the price goes up too much then you go well this
26:24
isn't really worth it for for what I'm looking for um so so having that fixed pricing that you can lock in is is
26:32
really important so yeah I just wanted to share on screen just to see uh what the
26:38
products look like so um so these are the bundles that you were referencing before so you can get like an IG layer
26:44
plus Renzo cover an IG layer plus ethery plus Pendle cover this this is really
26:49
cool and so let's say if I were to click on let's say this one with kelp Dow I'll
26:55
would then be able to enter how much I'd like to cover so let's say like you said 10 eth uh and then you said up to 365
27:02
days as well and it'll tell me my yearly cost here as well and this I'm guessing varies depending on the length so if I
27:09
choose only one month it's costing uh around just under 10% but if I choose a
27:15
longer period it's a little bit more now this is so a couple things here um on
27:22
this go back to 365 days yeah because this is an important thing to talk about too in staking pool people can stake and
27:29
delegate their nxm for a certain period of time some people can they can lock you can lock for up to 2 years or you
27:35
can basically put it in and lock it into a position for like 90 days 180 days whatever basically on like a quarterly
27:41
basis so the amount of capacity that will be available for a Year's period um
27:47
and people generally aren't buying cover for an entire year it's going to be very limited so as you can see uh you can see
27:53
up on cover amount in the top right corner it says Max under the cover details section oh yeah and so that
28:00
shows you the actual capacity that is available um if you let's say go to 1
28:05
eth I don't even know if there is capacity for 365 days it doesn't look like there's any capacity at 365 for
28:12
this specific product but if you go down to 180 days let's see what it
28:18
shows let's just go for around 180
28:24
days ah okay see look there's a 1,300 e now available yeah and so you can you
28:30
can see how much is there and you can see what the cost is at that at that price as well and then if you move it
28:37
down to the minimum period Then you can see what the price is so if you just go to 28 days you can see it's much lower
28:44
there's more capacity at that price um so depending on the amount of time that you want to buy cover for uh you know
28:50
there is that option as well um and then if there isn't cover available there's
28:56
actually an option um I think it maybe if you have your wallet connected but it'll show you like there's no Capac there's not enough
29:02
capacity available and you can actually request capacity to be opened up within the UI and then that message is routed
29:08
over to staking pool managers as well so you can actually communicate directly with the staking pool managers through
29:13
through the UI oh that's lovely that's a really nice feature actually uh
29:19
okay actually one thing I wanted to point out too here is if you look um at
29:26
the pricing on here so if you zoom in a bit for folks you can see let's go back
29:31
on there um actually I want to go back up to that main page because it shows the
29:36
pricing spreads this goes back to we talk with the staking pools so you can see the amount of capacity that's
29:42
available and you can see the the pricing so you can see for something like Igan layer kelp down and pendall
29:48
pricing ranges from 99.3% to almost 32% so that again is based on the Range
29:54
that's offered between the pools um there is one pool where it's very high and that's because they've sold a lot of
30:01
this cover and so Dynamic pricing has shifted that price up and then the lowest price pool you can see that range
30:06
so we provide that range just to let people know this is basically what the pools are are pricing that risk at and
30:11
so that's like across all the pools this is the range and then the amount of capacity that's available so you can
30:18
actually preview the range that's being offered across all the pools right here on the on the browse covers page what's
Dynamic Pricing and Market Demand
30:24
really interesting is like um the range for something like this IG layer with kelp and Pendle is quite high but if you
30:31
look at like let's say the range for igen layer Renzo and Pendle is significantly lower wh why is that
30:37
exactly yeah that goes back to demand um so if you were look at how much active cover is available or how much active
30:44
cover is currently on like Igan L kelp toow and Pendle people have bought a lot
30:51
of that cover recently and so that price has shifted up in some pools for Ian layer Renzo and Pendle the price is
30:57
lower so as that price shifts up it also decays down over time and so it decays
31:02
by 2% each day in each pool so in the highest price pool it's going to come down um by roughly about about 2% so
31:10
there's a certain velocity that that the price decays at that comes back down um and and this basically allows for Price
31:17
Discovery within certain pools so that we're not uh underwriting risk at too low a price but this also again spreads
31:23
coverb across pools it's going to jump up four pools like I imagine the highest price pool probably for this is the pool
31:30
that I underwrite with uh which is pool 22 there's not as much capital in there as let's say pool two or pool three or
31:36
four so pools with more Capital aren't going to be as price sensitive so if they sell a lot of cover the price will
31:43
move up by not not buy like nearly as much as it will in a pool with with less capital in it is there a way to see that
31:50
on the on the app as well the active cover amount uh just the the different
31:56
pools itself oh yeah if you click on stake so we've redone the buy cover but
32:01
if you click on stake it'll take you to the older version of the app y um sometimes this takes a minute to
32:07
load but in here you can see all of the different staking pools some of them have nxm in them some of them don't um
32:14
some of them are actively managed you can see like pool one is is the foundation pool um they have about 16 in
32:21
a half thousand in exam that they underwrite with there is Hu carp the founder his personal pool that he writes
32:28
with there are the two ease pools that they underwrite with and so you can see how much nxm they have that they're
32:34
underwriting risk with and you can see the pool apy for what people in that pool are
32:40
earning as well and so you can go through you know if you were to click on one of these you can go in and see
32:46
exactly what they're underwriting in the pool as well what they've set them in pricing at what the spot pricing is at
32:51
um you know what the current weight is what the Max Capacity is and you can see all these different products how many
32:58
pools are there give or take right now there are 22 I have the most recent pool
33:03
so pool 22 is mine um this one is the one that we were just looking at I
33:09
believe was the foundation that was a next yeah that was yeah that was a foundation one can you maybe PA 22 let's
33:17
go to that one yeah wow nice nice apy yeah what's the
33:22
apy again it's like uh 24 242 or something
33:28
and and like uh how do you uh how does one decide like or how how do you for
33:35
example recommend someone or explain to him the benefits of actually becoming U like opening such a pool you know what I
33:43
mean like how difficult is the process as well and like uh for for whom is it
33:48
if you know what I mean like what kind of an investor or whatever you should be uh in order to actually like think about
33:54
this yeah so I think there there's two functions one is you can stake nxm and delegate it to a pool manager or you can
34:02
create your own pool you can run your own pool you can set your own um you know variables in the pool the capacity the pricing um I have been researching
34:10
risk for three years in defi um I handle all a lot of the listing process I have
34:16
a due diligence process that I go through when I'm looking at these things so I have a risk framework in mind when
34:21
I'm underwriting risk and looking at things um everybody has a different one I think it it's like running the pool
34:28
itself is not for the average person um you're taking on risk I mean if you're staking nxm and you're underwriting
34:33
cover whether you're delegating it to a pool or you're running your own pool if you sell cover and there is a loss and
34:39
people file claims that bought cover from your pool if those claims are approved and paid then nxm in your pool
34:45
is going to get burned and that nxm that gets burned unlocks capital in the capital pool that's used to pay out
34:51
those claims so I mean there is risk when you're underwriting cover for sure um but what you can do is you can
34:57
control the amount of exposure you have to anyone risk you can underwrite cover you can set how much capacity you're
35:03
willing to underwrite so um if you were go to go back to that I can walk you through some of the things in in my um
35:10
let's go let's go back to it and everything and I can talk about some things why pricing is higher why capacity is open for certain
35:16
things um and so with this you can also see on the details part right you can
35:22
see the apy which I know is everyone's favorite part but you can also see the pool leverage so you can underwrite cover with up to 20 times leverage so in
35:30
my pool there is 7100 nxm some of it is mine some of it is nxm that's been
35:36
delegated to me by other members and the amount of Leverage is how much cover you're underwriting so you can only
35:42
underwrite for one risk 100% of the nxm that you have in the pool but you can
35:47
underwrite on multiple risks now if a claim is paid out for one of those risks
35:53
it's going to reduce the amount of nxm you have in the pool and it'll reduce the amount of capacity that you have in the pool it's very unlikely that if
36:00
there was a loss event that you would have multiple claims coming in for single cover products for some of the
Managing Risk as a Pool Manager
36:07
bundles there is kind of correlated exposure but again these are things that you can you can control these are also
36:13
things that you can watch and you can match correlation with that's something that we keep track of within the mutual
36:19
the limit threshold for like the total amount of cover that across all pools can can be sold is 20% of the capital in
36:26
the pool um so you know there are like Risk controls in place for the overall mutual and for each pool again the most
36:34
you can underwrite is 100% of the capital that you have but you can underwrite on multiple on mult multiple risks and this is how in the traditional
36:41
Insurance world this is how it works they underwrite with they underwrite more risk than the capital they have they uh invest a float to earn Revenue
36:49
off of idle capital in the pool and then those investment earnings are used to um
36:55
buildup Capital that can be used for future claims as well so anyways going back to my specific
37:01
pool um four things that have been around you know I'll open up 50% I have less Capital so opening up more cover um
37:09
takes more capacity in in in my pool uh if you have a lot of cover or a lot of
37:14
nxm that you have staked you can open up a lot of cover by allocating a smaller weight but it's the weight of the amount
37:19
of nxm so when you see 50% that means I'm underwriting it with 50% of the
37:25
total nxm that I have in my pool you can look at something for example like vrone V2 and that one's at
37:32
100% um it's at 100% because I had somebody that came to me and said I want to buy vdrome cover but there's not
37:39
enough capacity I've looked at the pricing in your pool I would like to buy cover from you uh at that price would
37:45
you be willing to open up more cover so in that sense I had deal flow where somebody said I would like to buy cover
37:50
from you it'll get red your pool I like your pricing can you increase capacity and so I did that um so they cover and
37:59
you can see the pricing is higher for valad Drome because they bought cover and they basically maxed out my pool and so that shifts pricing up um if you look
38:06
at some um some other things in here as well uh I have less exposure to some of
38:12
these other risks but again I usually start somewhere in the 15 to 20% range if there's demand then I'll scale up
38:18
capacity over time I typically only scale up a lot of capacity for something where somebody's either indicated they want to buy cover or we're seeing a lot
38:24
of cover buys coming through the more exposure have I typically start increasing my pricing because the more
38:31
exposure I take on the more risk I take on and then there's more risk versus reward um just some of the pricing I I
38:36
usually start things kind of high and then I'll lower them um to kind of see
38:42
what the market is willing to pay for certain risks there's some risks where I'm just not willing to come down below
38:47
a certain price to underwrite that risk so again you can look at like an ease pool and in ease they have like a
38:53
formula that they use to underwrite certain risks but you know there's like a general rule of thumb I I really don't
38:59
underwrite uh like compound V2 Forks um I'm not a huge fan of underwriting Forks in general um when
39:07
I'm looking at different things I'm looking through the audit history and even if a protocol is audited you have to look at the Audits and see like were
39:13
there a lot of vulnerabilities that were discovered um were the vulnerabilities that were discovered were they actually
39:19
fixed or were they just acknowledged and they said like we're fine with this so you're looking through all of those things so I do a lot of due diligence on
The Future of DeFi Insurance and Market Growth
39:25
all of these listings and I'm still working on writing up my risk framework to put on on the governance Forum so
39:31
people can review that but I'm going to start putting in like weekly updates just highlighting like you know what
39:37
things I'm underwriting and what products I'm adding um and everything and just providing like holistic updates
39:42
on a weekly basis for my pool so that's how that's how I run my pool how many uh
39:48
like Protocols are like for example covered right now uh on on your
39:53
pool um I have a pretty pretty recent utilization uh I'd have to like go in
40:00
and and break it down um we're still working on our Dune dashboards like you can see like active cover and you can
40:06
look in like on on our cover doing dashboard you can kind of see how many covers my pool has sold it doesn't break
40:13
down so much um I think this one this is the Richard Chen dashboard that's right
40:19
so if you uh if you type in Nexus into the search bar
40:26
here and and search for that you should be able to see CU we have some of the Dow ones so that Nexus Mutual covers is
40:31
the one that we can look at this one yeah perfect this is a dial created one
40:36
so if you go down um you can see the active cover which is at about 69 a.
40:41
half million and then if you scroll down a little bit more you can see the V2
40:47
covers um which is I think a bit further yeah it's a bit further down you'll see
40:52
that it'll look like a a database right there perfect uh this is is that's the
40:58
V1 these are the V2 covers so you can see the covers that have come through so we just had liquid Collective buy a
41:03
really large cover that got routed to staking pool number five and you can see that over by the product type tag you
41:10
can see what staking pool it was routed to so for some of these covers if one pool doesn't have enough capacity to
41:15
underwrite the whole risk that somebody wants to buy cover for it'll get split across a couple of different staking
41:21
pools so for my pool mine's pool 22 so you can see I didn't take on the total
41:27
risk for a certain risk so I think if we can find one like cover ID 652 or 662 um
41:38
652 yeah yeah that one's for Trader Joe so that one got split
41:43
across pool two and pool seven it looks like MH so you it it doesn't show how
41:49
much each pool underwrote the cover for but you can see how much figure the
41:54
cover Fe are between the two of them yeah still something that we have to work on is to break out like what exposure uh a staking pool has we have a
42:01
staking dashboard but it's currently not um it's not updated uh there's there's something wrong with it so we just
42:07
onboarded a new Dune Wizard and he's getting up to speed on things so that should be fixed here in the next few
42:13
weeks um but yeah we have quite a few dashboards that cover all the metrics within the mutual as well here on Dune
42:19
there's so much interesting data probably about uh like an emerging market like uh Insurance within within
42:27
uh def that it's kind of M like it's insane like I I'm I'm kind of curious
42:34
about like in your mind what's the best metric to uh demonstrate or some of the
42:40
best metrics to demonstrate how early this industry actually is because I think that you know like when I started
42:47
with the with like def summer of 2020 and I started like U learning about the
42:53
fact that there's an actual like new emerging Finance that pretty much no one
42:58
that I knew back then knows about I think that two of the use cases that I
43:04
was most actually stand that are going to like emerge is lending and insurance
43:10
and and I think that lending is already like like the market is much more open already to uh to lending money like it's
43:17
mostly what defi is all about like of course like per and Stu like price
43:23
speculation but that's not exactly like a financial service uh I think uh in a way and but but lending markets are so
43:30
you but you know I I think that I don't I don't know the actual sizes of the these industries like worldwide but I
43:38
you know insurance is is something huge you know like it's not it's one of the biggest industries out there but I still
43:46
think that you know the the adoption of it even with products like Nexus that
43:51
are like specifically oriented to the what we do now with lending and all like the money Market that we do it's still
43:58
pretty small I think I think I I I thought about it when you showed like that stat over there I don't remember exactly what it was that that showed
44:06
like 69 million of like open coverage or something like that active cover yeah
44:12
yeah I I to me it just seemed like it kind of shows it's of course like it's a
Challenges and Opportunities in the Insurance Sector
44:19
lot but it still kind of shows like how small are we and how early this whole industry is because this can go like
44:25
several magnitudes uh High yeah absolutely um I mean the the
44:32
onchain coverage Market is still like very very early uh we know we've underwritten a lot of cover like back in
44:38
the day we were underwriting like over a billion in cover um again crypto prices were higher uh you know we've been as
44:44
high as like a billion we've underwritten a total of like 465 billion in in cover since we started
44:50
oh okay so we've underwritten quite a bit of cover but one of the things I think that's not wory
44:55
about D Defi and the people that are active on chain is it's still a relatively small pool of people and it's
45:01
a lot of the same people um so lending markets why are lending markets taking off the number one use case for Lending
45:07
markets is leverage right people are Levering up to earn yields and if we look at two of the main drivers of yields right now in
45:13
defi uh it's it's Athena usde and sde right the the shards campaign and then
45:20
people earning the yields by by staking it but primarily what people are doing is they're farming shards um you know to
45:26
get the ENA token so that's one massive driver of yield for stable coins and for
45:32
liquid reaking tokens which is the primary like eth based yield it's farming points on igen layer the liquid
45:39
weaking protocols um and then you know basically creating a Points Market on Pendle so those are the two main drivers
45:46
and we've seen things like gearbox is taken off Pendle is taken off because of these yield things um and people are
45:51
Levering up on Moro blue on a like any lending Market people are taking out leverage for this so ultimately lending
45:58
in all these use cases are about earning yield um but what we do see is we see a very much risk on crowd people that hold
46:05
crypto in general are more risk on people that have been in this space have a different approach to risk management
46:11
there are a lot of people like when we use the term G dgen I think we use it pretty Loosely but real DG don't buy
46:17
cover right they put their money across 200 protocols and that's their full-time job they just Farm yield they might lose
46:23
a million dollars in one hack but they've got like $50 million across 200
46:28
other protocols so that's how they manage their risk that's not feasible for the average person so the people
46:34
that were seeing buy and cover are funds High net worth individuals people that are newer to the space um but
46:40
discoverability is one of the issues that we face is you know how do people find us how do people come in and I
46:47
think most of us that have been in the space for a while we actually can't answer that question I I I I think even
46:52
myself like I talked to a lot of users but if you've been in crypto for more than a year you no longer can answer the
46:58
question like what are the hurdles that new users face but I think what we see with most people is most people get in
47:05
and they'll either find a Coin or they find something or they find a protocol right like a pull together like they use
47:10
their first protocol and their world is limited to maybe three protocols exactly they don't really know anything outside
47:16
of that right so they don't trust things they're very skeptical but they know they they trust what they know and they
47:22
might not know about these risks that they're taking on the traditional Legion you know yeah so but but I mean some
47:28
people it's just they've gotten into the space they know they can make money they've read something somewhere they've put funds in they feel safe nothing
47:35
bad's happened yet and they're just not aware of like some of these risks so again like their worldle view is is on
47:40
the smaller side um so there are people that that just don't know that they can buy cover one of the things with Nexus
47:46
Mutual V2 is people can build on top of us they can create their own staking pools and they could basically build a
47:51
business that is a staking pool and like a third party distribution service in
47:57
together we refer to those as as a Syndicate basically so someone's building a business they can underwrite cover they can develop new cover
48:02
products and they can bring those to Market um to reach new people so open cover for example like I said before
48:09
they're they're on l2s so they're making cover accessible to people that can't buy cover on Main net because the gas
48:14
fees are too high as more people build on top of the mutual I think we'll be able to solve some of these problems um
48:21
I think there's there's a lot of stuff we have in the pipeline um you know some incentives that we're putting together to help people will start building on
48:27
top of us to help people like you know learn more about Nexus there's a lot of initiatives that we'll be shipping here
48:32
in Q2 on that front but I think that's what we need to do and and one of the things um that we're doing as well is we
48:40
have like uh SDK and our SDK documentation ready so if somebody wants
48:45
to integrate the ability to buy cover in their protocol's front end they can do that and it's just a couple Clips clicks
48:51
for someone to buy cover at the point of deposit and for a lot of people you know they don't they can buy coverage so
48:58
having that there increases discoverability and lets people know oh I can actually buy coverage for this
49:03
protocol um so I think those are a lot of the things that we need to get more people to buy cover I think if you're
49:10
looking at the metric which I think is kind of where we started this conversation what's the metric that you can look at to see how early we are look
49:16
at the amount of like people that are actually covered against these risks in D5 versus how much money is actually in
Onboarding New Users and Expanding Coverage
49:22
Defi and it used to be 1% it's much much smaller than that now there's not a lot of people that are buying cover um but
49:28
there's people that are losing a lot of money every year due to hacks scams and and some of these things so uh again we
49:34
have products kind of in the works that can kind of address some of these different issues too that'll be coming out soon interesting what can you
49:41
showare but uh some of the things I can't share I would really like to um some of the
49:47
stuff I I that I can talk about that we're working on is like we're working on dpay cover uh which is something that
49:52
people have asked for before so uh with dpay cover you could underwrite risk for or um something
49:58
like uh something like d some you know the stable coins um if we are willing to
50:03
underwrite it something like usde uh but you could also have d-a cover for like liquid reaking tokens um
50:11
you know uh liquid staking tokens so if there is a dpeg by a certain amount
50:16
that's the claim trigger and then somebody's able to swap their you know LRT or LST for a payout in eth um so
50:24
that's one product that we're working on um you know bundle cover we just came out with there's some other things that
50:30
that we're that we're building one of them we don't have a good name for it yet but we're referring to it internally is like yield sharing where you would
50:36
stake a certain amount of like a yield bearing asset and part of the yield is harvested and that would be used to
50:42
basically pay the cover fees for your coverage and then you would just deposit into this faults and a portion of the
50:48
yield that you're earning would basically be going to pay for the cover fees and so it would be like being
50:53
natively covered by depositing yield bearing asset into one of these vaults just imagine if you had yield sharing
51:00
for for Athena's products or like some of the some of the lrts I mean I think
51:06
that would be massive really really big especially with the demand that we have for those products today uh in the
51:12
market right now I would love to see something like that yeah and I mean I think one of the pain points that we're talking about is it abstracts away the
51:18
actual process of having to buy cover soad of having to go through that process you just deposit a portion of so
51:24
like if again if you have like a 100 that's earning interest just for Simplicity sake you would deposit 10 e
51:31
right 10 e of your yield bearing asset and a portion of the yield on that 10 e would actually go to pay your cover fee
51:36
so it would be a relatively low amount that you would be paying but you wouldn't actually have to pay it it would just be being harvested from a
51:42
portion of that yield so you don't have to put all of your productive assets into this Vault it would just be a
51:47
portion to buy a certain amount of coverage so can youate
51:53
like maybe I didn't understand like what you explained like can you integrate like an insurance
52:01
service like you do like into the into the flow of someone when he's just
52:07
dealing with the protocol itself you know what I mean like like to to create it at the back end and then he really
52:13
doesn't do anything but it's like he's already offered a service that in that
52:18
includes at least at least to a certain amount you know I Oh you mean like like basically the crypto version of FDIC
52:25
coverage right I'm not sure what FDIC what FDIC is uh oh like like uh well at least in the US
52:31
there's this the concept of um like Federal insurance for deposits in a bank up to a certain amount so basically like
52:37
a default coverage on a protocol up to a certain amount let's say you would underwrite coverage for a protocol for
52:42
like20 million I'm saying for example like the protocol itself would would come to you guys and say that he wants
52:49
to like to have a product built which is built in in short you know what I mean
52:55
oh yeah I mean people can do that absolutely absolutely like I said we have either like one click coverage or I think it's a couple clicks but basically
53:01
you can integrate into the front end so somebody can buy it at your protocol level if there's something specific that somebody wants to build that's unique to
53:08
their protocol um it's there's a good chance there's some modular cover product that we already have that can be
53:13
adapted to that but yeah if people have ideas of of certain kinds of coverage that they want to buy that they're going to offer to their us users natively um
53:21
you know that's something that we can do as well so yeah and again if people want to build cover products and and run
53:27
their own businesses they can do that as well so there's a lot of optionality than the
53:34
mutual I think um yeah I think I think that would work really well um so D advisor on your point um uh I think
53:42
especially if uh Nexus kind of continued to build those products especially something like yield chair anyone could
53:48
basically build a front end and but basically display those products uh even the protocol themselves could do that
53:55
and like you know you could go to you can go to an app for example you can go to gearbox right now and I just had a
54:01
look on their passive pools they they do have a they do have a button which lets you protect your LP with Nexus mutual
54:07
and open cover and you can click the button but it does take you to you know the open cover then you have to connect
54:13
your your wallet and do kind of do the process again but uh yeah I would imagine a future where that's actually
54:19
integrated directly on the gearbox app itself and yeah that would be awesome that would be brilliant I'm looking
54:25
forward to seeing stuff like that yeah so we actually just we we just came out with that so um I imagine we'll be
54:31
seeing we'll be rolling that out in different places but you know we do have the ability now where you can basically embed it so you don't have to leave the
54:37
app you can just buy cover right in the app for your positions so
54:42
yeah I mean this uh like uh this gives such a better chance for such a product
54:50
to actually be used you know because even the the simple thing that is actually like opening another
54:57
website uh users just avoid every activity they possibly can you know what
55:03
I mean so the more you like know how to uh integrate it within the natural flow of uh using the specific dep they're
55:10
they're already using I think the reach that you guys can have is like so much
55:15
wider than what it is now especially because like you know such a
55:20
product like it can really be implemented as like uh I don't know like the status quo W like we can find
The Importance of Composability in DeFi
55:27
ourselves in a situation in a few years that we're like thinking about this this era and we're like oh my God no one was
55:33
even no one even had the insurance almost on their funds back then but I don't think it's the future we
55:39
necessarily going into you know I actually think that in five years or maybe a decade something like that I
55:46
think that not only the amount of money that we're going to have within the space is going to be magnitudes larger
55:51
but for sure like our standards and norms and like how we actually like uh
55:57
handle them and manage them will be different and I think one of the main differences will will be the fact that
56:02
like uh in insurance will be a much bigger thing than it than it is now I
56:07
really think that yeah I think um a few quick points
56:13
on that one is this is just composability right so like this is the example of how did a get to where they
56:19
are well a is this main like I I write like a newsletter each week and I talk about interest rates in in lending
56:25
markets and then like the basis for yield and Defi and so a is this building block that other people build on top of
56:31
a has gotten big because it's easy to build on top of a so you have the summer fies and the defi Savers and all these
56:37
people that build these other interfaces but they're building on top of a and so because people are building on top and
56:43
creating strategies that make it easy to use a a is able to grow significantly
56:48
but look at what gearbox has done for these complex leverage strategies you know like two years ago if you're using
56:55
leverage like like it was very difficult it was risky for a lot of people you had to manage positions it was always a
57:00
thing where like if you had a leverage position open depending on you know what your health Factor was you know people would be like hey you want to go out for
57:06
the weekend and you're like no thanks I have to stay at home um I have to watch my health factor and your you know
57:12
normal friends would be like what the hell are you talking about but like this is you know this is what for a lot of people leverage was it was either
57:18
something that was very automated so limited to some people and then gearbox comes along and they basically make a
57:23
very easy to use leverage product where I can lever up and I can earn these things and of course they've taken off
57:29
with you know uh Athena and these leverage re uh you know reaking tokens
57:34
um with all of these points like they've just really found product Market fit and they've made it very easy to access
57:39
these things and they're building on top of all of these other things so imagine that somebody comes across and they
57:44
build something like that on top of the mutual of course that's how we grow that's how we protect more people and
57:49
that's how we find like you know more product Market fit and that's how we make defi safer but also you can take
57:55
that same thing and expand into other markets as well whether it's discretionary reinsurance for traditional markets where we take
58:02
onchain capital and use that to underwrite risk and traditional markets um creating products that we can
58:07
basically like yield sharing that you can really only create on chain that are specific to our markets and I I think
58:12
you know the wider thing here is this is how we scale coverage this is how we get more people involved but that is
58:18
essentially the power of of you know blockchain Tech right being able to build on top of things making things
58:24
composable and reducing the the amount of overhead and the amount of knowledge that you have to do something and do it
58:29
safely the one thing I will say on the security side is there are a lot of protocols that put a lot of time a lot of effort a lot of money into their
58:36
security and you know you can do audits you can have code reviews you can have a bug Bounty program you can put a lot of
58:42
money towards these things but if there's a black hat out there that finds something at the end of the day if they conduct an exploit and you cannot
58:48
recover the money there's not really a lot of plans for what happens after like if there is a loss event there's not
58:55
much protection for the other side of it there's what we do at Nexus but there's not a lot of people offering this service so if you want to onboard more
59:03
people into defi if you want to bring more people on chain and have them participate safely you have to have the
59:08
other side covered and traditionally what we've seen is people either try to do Self insurance which is not very
59:13
efficient if people are trying to run it themselves a lot of people are using um like these self- Insurance funds that
59:19
are heavily correlated to their own protocol uh and if that happens like if if it's your governance token one like
59:25
it's not great from like a governance risk point of view if you're auctioning off your governance token at the worst possible time so your Insurance Fund is
59:32
going to shrink considerably and a loss of it and then you're auctioning it off in tranches um like it hasn't worked
59:38
historically that well and it does not work at scale uh and then you have things like um and I talked about this
59:43
before and it's not just Athena but as an example if you look at their Reserve fund a lot of it is correlated to Athena
59:50
itself whether it's USD and usdt in Unis swap V3 positions which you know if
59:56
there is worry and people start swapping out and it's all going to be usde um or they have SDI like a large holding of
1:00:02
SDI in their Reserve fund and now we know that D is correlated to Athena so
1:00:08
if you have correlated Assets in your Insurance Fund or in your reserve fund that are supposed to be there to protect
1:00:14
people in the event of like a Black Swan event um it's not really going to do you any good if it also goes to zero when
1:00:21
there's a you know a big exploit or a big loss event within your protocol W I didn't r realiz that I didn't realize
1:00:27
Athena had their own insurance protocol uh Insurance Fund with us s usde and SD
1:00:32
I thought it was just uh like cash reserves or Stables no you can see it I mean it's it's it's on chain um yeah
1:00:40
yeah yeah yeah last I checked it was like 32 and a half million it'll scale up over time as long as they have like the shards campaign they added I think
1:00:47
in the last week they added five million to it that's just an usdt that hasn't been swapped anything but if you look at
1:00:53
it it's primarily correlated assets so I mean that could change over time as well but um but but what happens like for
1:01:00
example with EA when it gets actually big because for example now you I think
1:01:05
that people are right that as big as it seems to us like relatively especially
1:01:11
to all the parties involved like it's not big money yet so there's no actual like at least the way I perceive it
1:01:18
like it's not as risky right now but I I see it like I think something like that
Final Thoughts on the Future of Nexus Mutual
1:01:24
can go like 50x 100x like who knows how big can it be and and when it gets to
1:01:29
these places I'm like will it still like all be uh you
1:01:34
know uh possible so I think my view is Athena
1:01:39
like the um the cash and carry trade like that itself is it risky kind of but it's not as risky as as some people have
1:01:45
made it out to be I don't think that's where the primary risk lies um I think a lot of the risk is they have the reserve
1:01:52
funds so if like rates go negative they have like 32 and a half million but they also have over two billion so like you
1:01:58
know looking at the reserve fund which is supposed to be there if rates go negative they can compensate people well it looks big when you compare it to the
1:02:04
size of the funds that are at play like it's not that big um and they actually have like in their Reserve fund which
1:02:09
they used to call the insurance fund they have like a study of like what happens and in the study there it's like over three years time they get to a
1:02:16
billion they do talk about like they'll their Insurance Fund or their Reserve fund will be underfunded if they see
1:02:21
significant growth they they've seen significant growth they Reser they're already there yeah it's not big enough so um that's one of the things but I
1:02:28
don't think it's the primary risk I think the primary risk is the cust the aspect and so what they've talked about is they use copper and they do offchain
1:02:35
they do offchain settlement and everything but and I could be wrong here but as far as I know binance where they
1:02:41
hold like at least half of the funds requires you to have assets on the exchange like you can't do settlement
1:02:47
from your multi-party computational wallet um unless that's been changed um
1:02:53
and and I'm not aware of it that's fine but the the there that's one risk and then the other risk is the regulatory
1:02:58
risk of something happening with Athena and then what are the rights of token holders this is something that um paper
1:03:04
Imperium on the maker Forum brought up and you know basically what block analytica had said in the review is it's
1:03:10
kind of murky but we think that that's kind of like an edge case and it's unlikely to happen um but what I will say is and I I think this kind of speaks
1:03:17
for a lot of people as you know Athena is a CI product until they come on chain and decentralize it is a CI product I
1:03:24
think people still have shell shck from FTX because you think everything's fine and then it just depends on the level of transparency you have um and then the
1:03:32
other side of it is like you know the the stable coin or the synthetic dollar design there's no difference between
1:03:38
those two terms in my mind but you're offering something that can actually trade below a dollar and the Redemption
1:03:43
mechanism keeps it one to one and other people have said this but if Athena is really only worth 80 cents per one usde
1:03:51
and you're redeeming it for a dollar then the last people that are out are going to be the ones that take the loss
1:03:57
so there are some things there they could change some of these things so there is there is risk but I think
1:04:02
people are focusing on the wrong risks when they're talking about this the biggest risk in my mind and again I think the Athena people have done a very
1:04:09
good job of trying to mitigate a lot of these risks and being transparent and clear about them but um one of the
1:04:16
things is they've grown very large let's not forget that Athena like launched in February you know they had like a like a
1:04:22
basically like beta where they were live but it was like a whit list feature but they've been live publicly um you know
1:04:29
for a couple months and they're already integrated that you know all across defi it's like $2 billion doar in assets but
1:04:35
the liquidity in the markets is is not very big so if people kind of rush to the exits and they're not kyc they can't
1:04:40
redeem like that does it does pose an issue so I mean there are risks there I think the biggest risks are it's been integrated everywhere and it's only been
1:04:46
around for a couple months that's not really on Athena that's not everybody else if anything it kind of speaks to the strength of Athena's BD team and the
1:04:54
willingness of people to kind of want to make money more than they consider some of the risks here
1:04:59
but super super interesting it's a CI product like to be honest I think that
1:05:06
if there's one similar thing that is more decentralized actually and it's not CI product it's something that both waj
1:05:12
and myself are kind of involved with FX protocol and by the way that's how I
1:05:19
actually met you uh when you were on the a show uh thankfully and I was really
1:05:26
like oh my God like this so this is so not common knowledge within like the
1:05:34
crypto space as it should be and honestly like yeah I definitely
1:05:42
agree with the specific risks that you have mentioned there but also I I think the the space is still so small that it
1:05:49
has to be this way because uh like most of the liquidity is still like on these
1:05:55
places and until we actually get a lot more liquidity on boarded on chain we're
1:06:01
going to have these hybrids of uh CI as well but we should actually use them as
1:06:06
instruments to bring more capital on chain with time like I actually think in
1:06:11
the longer run they will actually like just push more capital on chain whether
1:06:17
it's by awareness and whether it's by purpose or not it will end up just like
1:06:23
bringing more capital in yeah there are means to an end until we can build out more infrastructure like nois pay and
1:06:29
things like this where you can actually exist without them um what I will say from a risk perspective is C5 products
1:06:35
are kind of a black box because you can't look at the risk the same way you can with an open source protocol with
1:06:41
things that are onchain that you can clearly review and identify um somebody can say they have a lot of money and
1:06:46
then all of a sudden one day they go you know what we lied we don't have a lot of money you think money out out of Lu
1:06:51
so we've seen that we saw that happen after 3 AC blew up and and Tera
1:06:57
yeah yeah we have money and then they're like actually just kidding we don't yeah
1:07:03
actually used it we did yeah we used it never mind like we don't we the money now anymore maybe maybe one day like
1:07:10
maybe maybe we can get it back like all all in one trade as they say you know
1:07:15
and like make up for whatever I want to touch on another point there Brave you
1:07:20
mentioned earlier that one of the newer audiences that are like probably going to be more more demanding of insurance
1:07:27
uh products are like uh you know the the nonion capital like like you said and
1:07:33
you said something about funds for example or I'm I'm sure that any other types of like uh investor who investors
1:07:40
who are not like uh just private investors like people opening up wallets
1:07:45
maybe you can share a bit about like how uh Nexus even like uh maybe tries to
1:07:51
onboard these kinds of new user and create these new connections that maybe will uh like because I really think that
1:07:58
uh it is a specific sector that insurance at least nowadays is there's
1:08:05
kind of a bigger pmf there maybe no yeah so I mean there's a lot of people that want to come on sh they want
1:08:12
to you know deploy funds they want to earn yield and that might be funds family offices High net worth
1:08:18
individuals that want to come on a lot of these people they they know that they can earn yield here and they have like
1:08:24
some expertise but they don't really know about the risks and so they either they want to buy cover because they're
1:08:29
not familiar or they they just have an obligation to their investors that they
1:08:35
have to have some mechanism to prevent losses so there is a big audience there
1:08:40
we're seeing like Outreach for more funds that are looking for cover um more people that are active that are looking
1:08:46
to earn uh you know last year we didn't see as much activity but yields were very low and yields have ramped up so
1:08:51
we're starting to see more people coming back and then you're going to have people that come come on chain and want to earn yield because they're being
1:08:58
onboarded through things like bass more retail users coming on l2s I mean there's a lot there with a account
1:09:03
abstraction some of these things I think the endgame is to make something where people don't really realize they're
1:09:09
interacting with crypto but they're on you know blockchain crypto rails and they're able to earn money in a way that
1:09:15
they probably wouldn't have access to In traditional markets um you know and more of like a fintech application we're not
1:09:21
quite there yet but I think consumer crypto is going to be a big thing here in this cycle and the next cycle so that's kind of what you need and in that
1:09:27
sense like we talked about before you need to abstract away the cover buying process so that people are like natively
1:09:33
covered when they're deploying into protocols or they have a very easy option to do it where they don't have to
1:09:38
you know make decisions and review a bunch of things they can just deposit into a pool and they're natively covered so I think that's the main thing um with
1:09:45
the account abstraction and things I think there's a lot of different ways that you can get around that I think for
1:09:50
people that are looking like for example I talked about like bridging onchain capital and traditional markets what you
1:09:56
need to do there is you need to create a user experience where somebody can come they can onramp funds they can pay for
1:10:03
their cover and again they don't really know that they're interacting with crypto because really they just want to buy die denominated cover they want
1:10:09
dollars that's that's what they're covering in the real world so you know that is something that's in a road map is to research a kind of abstraction to
1:10:16
to look at user interfaces that can cater to those markets and make user interfaces for people um either
1:10:22
ourselves or through the people that are building on top of us that cater to these different audiences and again that's one of the powers of having
1:10:28
people build on top and run their own syndicates you know run their own distribution platforms is you can have multiple different user experiences um
1:10:35
for different market segments I agree man and composability
1:10:42
is so huge I think that like you said earlier like the more uh the more people
1:10:47
can do like a benefit from all this kind of stuff in a way that they don't even like have to communicate with uh one
1:10:54
another and it's like uh the process is like as smooth as possible I'm convinced
1:11:00
that we're going to see this sector grow like so much we could have had new one at least
1:11:06
for I think like we should have like a sequel for this one kind of stone
1:11:11
because I think that you know again this is a specific sector
1:11:17
within the industry that is just not still not getting the attention and respect I think it uh it will pretty
1:11:24
soon do with I mean like because it can't go on like forever you know what I mean this is
1:11:29
such a basic product in finance that I I don't see it like uh staying uh in the
1:11:36
magnitude that it is right now yeah well I mean like I said before our like main priority is growth so it's going to I
1:11:42
think up to us to kind of move on that front create products that that help people and meet them you know where they
1:11:48
need to be met uh and so we're going to grow cover sales significantly like that's our goal we've already seen a lot
1:11:53
of growth here in q1 and just to start a Q2 we've sold a lot of cover um we' basically doubled our active coverage
1:11:59
here in you know in the first part of the year so our goal is to 10 20 20x cover sales here by the end of the year
1:12:06
so I think we're well on our way to that um but yeah I mean happy to come back another time we can run through claims
1:12:11
and and you know past claim events we can run through a lot of stuff there's like I said before a lot of stuff to talk about um regarding the mutual but
1:12:18
but yeah I think we covered a lot of ground today yeah I just wanted to say um oh thank you so much for it because uh yeah
1:12:25
it was a it was an eye opener for me especially with the stuff that you shared with us before the call as well
1:12:30
um learning about Nexus has been really interesting and I think today hopefully not just ourselves but the viewers have
1:12:36
also been able to learn a lot uh and perhaps some of them will be opening up their covers or or buying some cover
1:12:41
fairly soon uh to protect themselves against some of the risks again that we covered in quite a lot of detail today
1:12:47
um so yeah no more questions on my side the advisor anything else that you wanted to ask before we close up today
1:12:53
uh not that much like I want to too many questions so I won't start now you know
1:12:59
I really think you you have a very interesting product very unique and I really think that uh many people have a
1:13:05
lot to benefit if they know more about it and check it out and again guys not Financial advice although on this case
1:13:12
specifically it's not like exactly the non-financial advice because it's kind of a product that is the op the opposite
1:13:18
of Deens where we where we usually just like yeah not Financial advice but I'm
1:13:24
buying this mcoin but this time not Financial advice but consider taking a look at some insurance
1:13:31
by Nexus Mutual what I always say to people is do your due diligence do research ask questions I love answering
1:13:38
questions um I love helping people understand you know what we do with the mutual and like I've said before I'm an open book so there's nothing anybody's
1:13:44
asked me that I haven't been asked before um I really appreciate it when people ask questions and you know put in
1:13:50
some effort to understand what are is we're doing and I I try my best to educate people and kind of point out all the risks the things we cover and the
1:13:56
