Intro
0:00
it keeps me up at night all those risks
0:03
that we face
0:04
in the defy space sure we try to claim
0:06
that it's risk versus reward
0:08
but there are some risks that are hard
0:10
to quantify
0:11
hard to hedge and harder to handle
0:14
these are tail risk events like smart
0:16
contract bugs and hacks
0:18
the proverbial black swan in the crypto
0:21
space
0:22
so wouldn't it be great if we could take
0:24
this risk off the table
0:26
insure ourselves against these
0:27
relatively unforeseen and
0:29
catastrophic risks or even better
0:32
could we do this in a completely
0:34
decentralized and trustless way
0:37
well now there is a way and it's through
0:39
a service
0:40
called nexus mutual and in this video
0:43
i'm going to give you everything that
0:45
you need to know
0:46
about the project what it is how it
0:49
works
0:50
tech team and use cases
0:53
i'll also be taking you through the nxm
0:55
tokenomics
0:56
and giving you my personal take on its
0:58
adoption and price potential
1:01
you won't want to miss that
1:03
[Music]
1:10
before we talk insurance i need to
1:13
ensure that i
1:14
am legally insured this is not
1:17
investment advice in any way shape or
1:20
form it is purely educational content
1:22
that you should use as a complimentary
1:24
resource
1:25
to your own research also i'd like to
1:28
take the time to welcome all those users
1:30
new to the channel my name is guy and
1:33
over here at the bureau
1:34
i cover everything crypto i love doing
1:37
deep dive reviews
1:38
on projects so if that's something that
1:40
you could get value from
1:42
be sure to subscribe you may also want
1:45
to turn on all those notifications to be
1:47
sure you get it while it's fresh out of
1:48
the kitchen
1:50
and finally feel free to adjust the
1:52
playback speed to your preference
1:54
oh and you may also find these
1:56
timestamps that i've placed over here
1:58
quite handy right that's enough of the
2:01
intros
2:02
let's get going so
What is Nexus Mutual?
2:05
what the hell is nexus mutual well it's
2:08
a decentralized
2:09
insurance protocol that's built on
2:11
ethereum it allows users to take out
2:13
cover
2:14
or protection for specific risks that
2:16
exist in the crypto ecosystem
2:19
what makes nexus mutual unique from the
2:21
likes of your traditional insurance
2:23
company
2:24
is that the insurance pool is
2:25
decentralized users will pool their
2:28
assets in a decentralized and
2:29
transparent manner
2:31
risk is shared across the pool and so
2:34
are the potential rewards so basically
2:36
when you buy cover from nexus mutual
2:39
you're becoming part of that
2:40
decentralized ecosystem
2:42
you are protected in the event of hacks
2:44
but you can also reap rewards
2:46
from the growth of the broader pool it's
2:49
a pretty nifty
2:50
economic model where users are part of
2:52
an ecosystem and have a stake in the
2:54
general riskiness of the pool
2:56
the first feature that they've added is
2:58
smart contract cover
3:00
this basically allows users to secure
3:03
the risk that is presented by smart
3:04
contract errors or hacks
3:06
sometimes some of the most costly
3:09
something else that you need to know
3:10
about nexus mutual is that it's a
3:12
company that is limited by guarantee
3:14
in the united kingdom it operates under
3:17
a discretionary
3:18
mutual structure which means that all
3:20
insurance claims are paid at the
3:22
discretion of the board
3:23
i.e all other members of the nexus
3:26
mutual ecosystem
3:28
this also means that when joining the
3:30
mutual you become a legal member
3:32
of a uk company your membership rights
3:34
will be backed by legal agreements
3:37
all members will have legal rights to
3:39
the pool of funds
3:41
nexus mutual was launched back in may of
3:43
2019 and it raised an undisclosed sum
3:45
from
3:46
early investors including the likes of
3:47
kinetic blockchain capital collider
3:50
ventures etc
3:51
the team is comprised of 10 individuals
3:53
and it's led by a chap called hugh carp
3:56
he has over 15 years experience in the
3:58
insurance industry
4:00
it's also important to point out that
4:02
they did not conduct any sort of ico
4:04
it's structured around this mutual
4:06
membership where the tokens
4:08
are only sold through nexus mutual and
4:10
users have to be verified to take part
4:12
i'll cover this more in a bit now
4:16
before i talk about how nexus mutual
4:18
works i want to briefly go
4:20
over why it's so badly needed
Why it is Needed
4:23
as mentioned in the intro smart contract
4:26
vulnerabilities are risks that many
4:27
people know exist but
4:29
find hard to quantify how much could
4:32
theoretically be lost if a hacker was to
4:34
breach
4:34
a smart contract or how about funds that
4:37
get destroyed by a smart contract bug
4:40
it ranges from small loss to a complete
4:42
and total loss
4:43
to everything in between sure you can
4:46
attempt to mitigate this risk
4:48
you can have your code audited you can
4:50
offer bounties and have it pen tested
4:53
however there's always that risk that
4:54
something has not been picked up
4:57
that all those eyes on the code have not
4:59
been able to spot something
5:01
here's an example many of you will no
5:04
doubt have heard about that infamous
5:06
ethereum dow hack
5:07
if you've not allow me to refresh your
5:09
memory
5:11
this happened back in 2016 when a
5:13
project called the dao
5:15
raised over 12.7 million ether in
5:18
exchange for their dow tokens
5:20
at that time it was worth over 150
5:23
million dollars
5:24
so pretty crazy even by today's numbers
5:27
long story short there was a
5:28
vulnerability in the dow code that
5:30
related to its infamous split function
5:32
a hacker was able to drain over 3.6
5:35
million each from the dow
5:36
using a recursive call exploit it was
5:39
such a catastrophic hack
5:41
that not only did it kill the dao but it
5:43
led to ethereum
5:44
splitting in two this is of course why
5:47
we have ethereum classic today
5:49
something that could have easily been
5:51
covered through a decentralized
5:52
peer-to-peer
5:53
insurance protocol here's another
5:56
example
5:57
for those of you who've watched my video
5:58
on polkadot you'll have heard me talk
6:00
about the parity
6:01
multisig freeze if you've not watched
6:04
the video then you can watch it right
6:06
here basically it was a multi-signature
6:09
wallet that was developed by the team
6:11
over at parity technologies
6:13
these were the same guys behind the
6:15
polkadot ico which managed to raise an
6:17
astronomical amount of money in the 2017
6:20
bull run
6:21
145 million dollars in total
6:24
parity also had some of the best brains
6:26
in the business including the founder
6:28
and ex-cto of ethereum
6:30
dr gavin wood as a matter of fact dr
6:32
wood was even the
6:34
inventor of the solidity smart contract
6:36
language
6:38
so one would think that these guys would
6:40
have left no stone unturned when
6:41
auditing the smart parity code
6:43
heck they were so confident of it that
6:46
they stored nearly all of their ico
6:48
funds in it
6:49
well along came an anonymous developer
6:52
called
6:53
devops199 who was messing around with
6:55
the code
6:56
they were trying to recreate a previous
6:58
parity exploit
6:59
anyway after a bit of light-hearted
7:01
experimentation
7:03
this bloke was able to completely delete
7:06
a wallet library contract the end result
7:08
was that wallet contracts were not able
7:10
to call the wallet library for
7:12
transactions
7:13
and that's just a technical way of
7:14
saying that the funds were frozen and
7:16
they were
7:16
royally screwed the end result is that
7:19
approximately
7:20
513 000 eth were lost forever
7:24
60 of all the funds raised by polka dot
7:26
were also lost
7:28
and unlike the case with dao hack the
7:30
ethereum developers did not come to the
7:32
rescue
7:33
there would be no chain splits and no
7:35
saving grace
7:36
one more example i want to throw you
7:38
away is that of yam finance
7:40
this was one of those recent high-flying
7:41
d5 projects that attracted millions of
7:44
dollars in tvl
7:45
in just a few days after launching they
7:48
also released their yam governance token
7:50
that users could farm
7:51
on the protocol well turns out there was
7:53
a bug in the rebasing contract which
7:55
adjusted the total supply of yams on the
7:57
market
7:58
the team rallied to fix it as quickly as
8:00
possible but the nature of the
8:02
governance on the protocol
8:03
could not issue a fix in time so
8:06
let's just quantify this yam finance tvl
8:09
went from zero dollars to as high as 500
8:12
million dollars
8:13
before falling to 280 million dollars
8:17
yam token jumped over 150 dollars and is
8:20
now trading at just below
8:22
one dollar okay so why
8:25
am i telling you all this no i'm not
8:27
trying to scare the bajibas out of you
8:29
i'm just trying to illustrate how much
8:31
of a risk smart contract vulnerabilities
8:33
can pose
8:35
these are exactly the kind of risks that
8:37
nexus mutual is trying to eliminate
8:39
and are what they cover in their smart
8:41
contract insurance
8:42
if these risks are reduced then we have
8:44
a defy ecosystem that is not only more
8:47
secure
8:48
but also less threatening to your
8:49
average user
8:51
so it's fair to say that there is a dire
8:53
need for solutions like those that are
8:55
provided by nexus mutual
8:56
but how in the hell does it all work
How to Buy Insurance
9:00
well in order to best understand this we
9:02
have to take a look at an example of how
9:04
you get that insurance
9:06
before you can take out that smart
9:08
contract cover there are three things
9:10
you need to know
9:12
what systems and protocols you're using
9:15
compound uni swap curve etc
9:17
how much you have exposed in each system
9:21
and
9:22
how long you would like the cover for so
9:25
for example you could be purchasing
9:27
insurance for the 5000 diet that you're
9:29
lending on compound finance for a year
9:32
of course if you are interacting with
9:35
more than one protocol through yield
9:37
farming tactics
9:38
then you are going to want to get cover
9:40
for each of the protocols
9:43
now that you know of your cover
9:44
requirements you can start the process
9:46
of becoming a nexus mutual member
9:49
what's important to point out here is
9:50
that kyc is required
9:52
you have to be verified to be a member
9:54
given you're becoming
9:55
a legal member of a uk company you'll
9:58
need to fill out all of the required
9:59
information
10:00
and pay a small membership fee of .003
10:04
eth
10:05
once that's done and you've been cleared
10:07
you can go ahead and purchase that
10:09
insurance
10:10
you'll need to connect your web 3.0
10:11
wallet and hit buy cover
10:14
you can then select your desired smart
10:16
contract from the list that's given
10:17
right
10:18
here after choosing the contract you
10:21
will need to select the amount that you
10:23
would like to cover for
10:24
it can be in eath or die after this
10:28
you can select the time that you would
10:29
like the contract to cover for you can
10:32
select in between a range of
10:33
30 to 1000 days then once that's done
10:37
you will get a quote if all is gravy you
10:40
will accept the quote
10:41
agree a disclaimer and then sign the
10:43
metamask transaction
10:45
and that's it you're now covered by
10:48
nexus mutual
10:50
if there is a smart contract fault of
10:51
any type then you can submit a claim in
10:54
the
10:54
manage cover section it's here that the
10:57
claim will be sent to claims assessors
10:59
to vote on
11:00
and this is an important point that you
11:02
need to note
11:04
nexus mutual is not a legally binding
11:06
insurance agreement
11:08
rather it is what is termed
11:09
discretionary covers
11:11
where those members and claim assessors
11:13
will determine whether the claim is
11:15
valid or not
11:16
i would also note that the smart
11:18
contract cover provides protection
11:19
against the technical risk of the smart
11:21
contracts failing
11:22
anything in the solidity code it does
11:25
not cover
11:25
such risks as oracle manipulation
11:27
governance attacks flash loan exploits
11:30
etc
11:31
so it would not have covered those
11:32
recent bzx attacks for example so
11:35
take note of that now then you know how
11:38
to get yourself
11:38
some smart contract insurance but what
11:41
is the deal
11:42
with that mxn token
The NXM Token
11:45
the nexus mutual token is an erc20 token
11:48
that gives users membership
11:49
to the mutual itself these tokens
11:52
represent
11:53
your membership rights what is important
11:56
to note here is that they can only be
11:58
bought and sold on the nexus mutual
12:00
platform
12:01
yes i know that you may see it on some
12:03
other exchanges but that
12:04
is wrapped nxm something that i'll touch
12:07
on in a bit
12:08
the token serves a very important role
12:10
in the nexus mutual ecosystem
12:12
firstly it's capital efficient and
12:14
allows for a scalable way to raise
12:16
capital
12:17
their unique tokenomic model will ensure
12:19
the inflow of funds
12:20
only when they are required secondly it
12:23
aligns incentives
12:25
all of those people who are members of
12:26
the mutual will benefit from the success
12:29
of the platform
12:30
they will all work towards a more
12:32
cohesive mutual
12:34
and finally the token price is directly
12:37
linked to the adoption and performance
12:39
of the underlying mutual
12:41
this is again through that unique token
12:43
economic model that i mentioned
12:45
now given that this economic model is
12:47
central to the mutual
12:49
i want to explore it in a bit more
Token Economic Model
12:51
detail
12:52
as mentioned nexus mutual controls the
12:54
supply issuance and redemption of the
12:57
token
12:58
this is all based on a continuous token
13:00
economic model where the price depends
13:02
on how much funds are in the mutual more
13:05
specifically
13:06
the price is a function of the minimum
13:08
capital requirement
13:10
mcr the higher the mcr the more
13:13
expensive the token becomes
13:15
here is the exact formula that is
13:17
applied to the price
13:19
a and c are just constants the mcr
13:23
percentage is the ratio of funds held to
13:25
funds required
13:26
so quite simply the mutual has adequate
13:29
funds when the amount of money it holds
13:31
is greater than the mcr here you can see
13:34
the exact relationship between the price
13:36
and the mcr percentage
13:38
what's pretty neat about this economic
13:40
model is that it uses the token price as
13:42
a means to capitalize the funds
13:44
it will dynamically decrease the price
13:46
of the token which means that it will be
13:48
cheaper
13:48
to become a member and hence buy cover
13:51
on the flip side
13:52
if more cover is purchased the capital
13:54
pool increases
13:55
this means that the mcr will also
13:57
increase but in most cases
13:59
it's less than the capital pool hence
14:02
the ratio will increase
14:03
and up the token price this is
14:05
beneficial for all members of the mutual
14:07
and shares the rewards so that
14:11
is the pricing dynamics now although the
14:13
token
14:14
does confer membership rights to the
14:15
mutual there are a number of other use
14:17
cases that come with it
14:19
firstly as mentioned you'll be able to
14:21
purchase cover for the insurance with
14:23
the token
14:24
this can either be done with nxm or it
14:26
can be done in eth or die
14:28
if it is done in the latter it's
14:30
converted into nxm to pay for the cover
14:33
90 of the cover price in nxm will be
14:36
burned and the remaining 10 will be used
14:38
when making those claims
14:40
nxm holders also play a key role in risk
14:42
or claims assessment
14:44
for example if there's a claim on the
14:46
mutual then members are required to vote
14:48
and come to a consensus
14:50
those who vote against the consensus
14:51
have their tokens locked for a certain
14:53
period of time
14:54
those who vote with the consensus are
14:56
rewarded in nxm tokens
14:59
then when it comes to that risk
15:00
assessment component users can signal
15:02
their confidence in the security of the
15:04
underlying smart contract
15:06
by staking nxm the more nxm staked on an
15:09
individual cover
15:10
the lower the price of the cover if the
15:13
cover is purchased
15:14
the staker receives nxm on the other
15:17
hand
15:17
if a valid claim occurs within 250 days
15:20
from the cover purchase
15:21
a portion of the stake is burned still
15:24
with me so far
15:26
if you're struggling don't worry all you
15:28
really need to understand
15:29
is that they've created an ecosystem
15:31
where you are not only able to take part
15:33
in the general claims process
15:34
but you can individually select which
15:36
contracts you would like to back
15:38
based on their individual risk profile
15:41
it gives choice now the final use case
15:44
that we have here is of course
15:46
governance nxm is used as a voting rate
15:49
and those who merely participate in
15:50
these votes
15:51
can earn themselves some nxm so it's
15:54
quite clear that nexus mutual has
15:56
created a unique token ecosystem with a
15:58
number of use cases
16:00
all of this creates value within the
16:02
ecosystem
16:03
they also have mechanisms in place to
16:05
keep supply in balance based on the
16:07
token burns
16:08
minting and redemption now of course
16:11
you're no doubt wondering
16:12
what this means for the price
Price Potential & WNXM
16:16
well as mentioned nxm tokens are priced
16:18
differently than other tokens
16:20
they're not market driven but are
16:22
dependent on that mcr ratio that i
16:24
talked about earlier
16:25
quite simply the more people that buy
16:27
cover on nexus mutual the higher the
16:29
token price
16:30
you have to ask yourself whether smart
16:32
contract insurance is likely to take off
16:34
and whether there is demand for covering
16:36
these well
16:37
if you take a look at the amount of
16:39
funds that have been locked in nexus
16:40
mutual smart contracts over the past
16:42
three months
16:43
it's quite telling those are all people
16:45
who are buying
16:46
smart contract insurance hire tvl
16:50
more capital in the mutual pool and
16:51
hence a higher price
16:53
moving over to the price chart you can
16:55
see that this has been feeding through
16:57
all of those people who joined the
16:59
mutual when it first launched have been
17:01
quite well rewarded in terms of
17:03
nxm price appreciation oh and this
17:06
then brings me on to the point about
17:08
wrapped nxm
17:10
as mentioned nxm tokens are not traded
17:12
on the open market
17:14
this means that they're not listed on
17:15
your regular exchanges
17:17
however wnxm is a wrap token that is
17:21
redeemable
17:22
one for one for your standard nxm tokens
17:25
the only small detail is that they can
17:27
only be redeemed by someone who is a
17:29
member of the mutual
17:31
you can then view it in the same way as
17:33
wrapped bitcoin where redemptions of
17:34
wbtc can only be done by the merchants
17:38
and from those who have completed the
17:40
kyc
17:41
if you're already a member and would
17:42
like to redeem or mint these wnxm tokens
17:45
then this can easily be done
17:47
through this handy dashboard right over
17:49
here
17:50
the wrapped version is traded on a range
17:53
of different exchanges over here
17:55
if you're looking to pick up any wnxm on
17:58
the open market then your two best
17:59
options are perhaps uni swap for a dex
18:02
option
18:02
or on good old binance for a centralized
18:05
alternative
18:06
oh and while we're on that i have
18:09
managed to get
18:10
you folks a 20 discount on trading fees
18:12
at binance
18:13
as well as a 10 bonus on a new account
18:16
so
18:17

Final Thoughts
18:22
speaking of wrapped tokens it's about
18:25
time i started wrapping this video up
18:28
i want to leave you with a few final
18:30
thoughts on nexus mutual
18:32
firstly i will say that they are no
18:34
doubt offering a unique service
18:36
while there are other companies that are
18:38
willing to ensure smart contract risks
18:40
they are centralized insurers not very
18:42
d5
18:43
if you ask me nexus mutual has created a
18:46
decentralized
18:47
trustless and transparent insurance
18:49
ecosystem where the users of the
18:51
contracts are members of
18:52
the broader ecosystem their wealth grows
18:55
with the broader pool and they benefit
18:57
from a less
18:58
risky and better capitalized pool it's
19:01
also a solution that's in dire need at
19:03
the moment
19:04
as was clearly illustrated smart
19:06
contract risks are
19:07
real they are those tail risks that lie
19:10
deep
19:11
in the code risks that were previously
19:13
pretty hard to pin down and eliminate
19:16
it gives me peace of mind to know that
19:18
the funds i have tied up in a certain
19:19
protocol are watertight
19:21
some people are deegans and prefer to
19:23
play fast and loose when it comes to
19:25
these things
19:26
but if you've been badly stung once by
19:28
one of these events
19:29
you will view this insurance through a
19:31
different lens the second time
19:33
as we've seen nexus mutual has been
19:35
growing and they have emerged as the
19:37
smart contract solution
19:39
for the d5 space in fact just recently
19:42
it was announced that yearn finance
19:44
would be
19:44
integrating nexus mutual smart contract
19:46
insurance in their
19:48
cover feature essentially this would
19:50
allow users of yeon finance to take out
19:52
insurance on the funds that they'd
19:54
stored in the urn finance vaults
19:56
for those of you who've seen my video on
19:58
yeon finance you know just
20:00
how much potential there is for this
20:02
ecosystem to grow
20:03
so yes i am quite optimistic about the
20:06
prospects of nexus mutual
20:08
of course i need to make you acutely
20:10
aware of the risks
20:13
the first and most important thing to
20:15
point out here is that the mutual is
20:16
taking on the risks of these smart
20:18
contracts
20:19
hence if there is ever a bug or hack
20:21
that results in a large claim on some of
20:24
the most popular insurance
20:25
funds in the mutual will be drawn while
20:28
the protocol is designed to make sure
20:30
that risks are always covered
20:32
this only works assuming that the same
20:34
vulnerability
20:35
isn't exploited on multiple smart
20:37
contracts that require
20:39
insurance it's called the law of large
20:42
numbers where the risks are viewed
20:43
independently so for example assume
20:47
there was some
20:48
unseen bug and code dependency that saw
20:50
a multi-pronged exploit
20:52
on the likes of compound yearn finance
20:54
uniswap
20:55
ave it could drain the entire nexus
20:58
mutual pool
20:59
and make it insolvent is it likely
21:02
no it's a minute risk it's
21:05
a tail risk of a tail risk but it's
21:08
still
21:09
possible and as such don't bet your
21:12
yield
21:13
farm on it that's it folks my overview
21:16
of nexus mutual and their nxm token
21:18
the time has come though what do you
21:20
think of it have any of you bought
21:22
insurance
