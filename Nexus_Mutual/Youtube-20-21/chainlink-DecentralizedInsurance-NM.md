Again, really excited to have Roxanna
0:02
Danilla joining us today. Really want to
0:04
appreciate you for for your time and
0:06
joining us. Uh goal this Q&A is to learn
0:09
more about the integration between Nexus
0:11
Mutual and Chain Link. Uh and to learn
0:13
more about how how we're working
0:15
together, uh updates from Nexus Mutual
0:17
and what's what's the plan for for 2021
0:20
and and where everything is headed. Uh
0:25
without further ado, yeah, I would love
0:27
to uh if you want to maybe just
0:29
introduce yourself and give the audience
0:31
just a little bit about your background
0:33
and and what Nexus Mutual does.
0:36
Uh sure. So, as you mentioned, my name
0:38
is uh Roxanna. I'm the CTO of Nexus. Um
0:42
my background is as an engineer. I used
0:44
to work for uh big tech before uh
0:47
joining Nexus. I've been involved in
0:49
crypto for a while. Um and I'm I'm
0:54
really excited about the the product we
0:56
are building. Um in very short Nexus is
1:00
a uh protocol that can provide an
1:04
alternative a decentralized alternative
1:06
to insurance. Um we've been on mainet
1:10
since May 2019. Uh and we've been uh
1:14
we've been have we've been growing quite
1:17
a lot over the over the past year. Um,
1:21
and yeah, I can I can get into a few
1:23
more details as we go along.
1:26
Cool. Yeah, thanks. Uh, yeah, you have
1:29
amazing, impressive background. Uh, and
1:32
you were working in in big tech at
1:34
Facebook previously, correct?
1:36
Uh, yeah, that's right.
1:38
What kind of drew you into blockchain,
1:40
cryptocurrencies, and getting into the
1:42
decentralized insurance space?
1:45
I guess uh as a lot of the people in the
1:48
space, I get I got down the uh Bitcoin
1:51
rabbit hole at some point far back. I
1:54
think the first time I heard about
1:55
Bitcoin was when uh someone in my
1:57
university was mining Bitcoin on the lab
1:59
machine on the you know machines in the
2:01
computer lab. Um but it didn't like I I
2:05
didn't quite get it at the time and then
2:07
I I kind of came back to it uh later on.
2:10
Um, and
2:14
the philosophy behind it, I think that's
2:15
a lot of what attracts a lot of people
2:17
and it's kind of it opens up a lot of p
2:20
new perspective and it got me reading
2:22
about econ econ economics and game
2:25
theory and all that stuff. Uh, and as an
2:28
engineer, you eventually uh get into or
2:31
at least in my case, I eventually got
2:33
interested in Ethereum. Uh it was super
2:36
at the beginning um at the time and uh
2:40
at some point what really really made me
2:43
actually quit my job and start working
2:45
in crypto full-time was the fact that
2:47
the community well it might sounds a bit
2:49
it might sound like a bit of a cliche
2:51
but uh the energy of the community that
2:53
I met in the uh crypto space was
2:55
absolutely amazing and reminded me a lot
2:58
of the earlier days at Facebook when you
3:00
know you went to work and every day you
3:02
were working with this group of really
3:03
smart and really really passionate
3:05
people and I think that's one of the
3:06
things that really drives me. Uh and
3:09
that's how I ended up the the more I
3:12
went to you know crypto events and met
3:14
people in the space the more I I really
3:16
wanted to join and I left Facebook and I
3:18
took a bit of a detour uh tried a bit of
3:22
an entrepreneurial journey. I started a
3:24
company uh closer to my previous
3:26
expertise, but I was going to pitch to
3:29
VCs that I knew from my crypto network
3:32
and literally five minutes into the
3:33
pitch, we would end up talking about
3:34
crypto. So, they're like, "What what are
3:36
you doing? You should totally be doing
3:38
you should totally be doing something in
3:40
crypto full-time." And actually, through
3:42
one of the uh VCs, I got introduced to
3:45
Hugh and that's how we we started
3:46
working together at the time.
3:48
Yeah, that's that's an amazing story. uh
3:51
really really cool and to see more, you
3:53
know, female engineers breaking into the
3:55
space and and growing it. Do for other
3:58
female uh aspiring to break into crypto
4:00
and be an engineer, do you have any
4:02
advice for them?
4:04
Uh that's a tough one. Um I guess just
4:09
don't be intimidated. I I I think it's
4:11
one of those industries that's kind of
4:12
hard to break in because one, the
4:14
learning curve is really steep, but
4:16
don't be discouraged by that. just keep
4:19
following your curiosity and keep
4:21
digging and um just get connected to
4:25
people you can relate to. I think that
4:26
made a big difference and be that male
4:28
or female. the people I made I met on
4:31
the way really made a difference in uh
4:34
in my journey and uh
4:37
yeah I think it's on all of us to
4:39
basically make this space a bit more
4:41
friendly and uh just highlight not
4:46
because they're women but you know
4:47
highlight in general any anyone who does
4:49
good work especially they're at the
4:50
beginning of their journey it's it's a
4:52
big encouragement and I think it helps
4:54
to uh add a little bit more diversity in
4:56
the space
4:57
yeah that's very well
4:59
So with with the Nexus Mutual would love
5:01
to kind of dive in and you know what
5:03
makes it unique compared to other
5:05
decentralized insurance products that
5:07
are out there and what is your core
5:09
focus on? Uh I think the one of the
5:13
unique things is uh in its name uh and
5:16
that's the mutual uh well first of all
5:19
Nexus mutual is the first product in uh
5:23
in the crypto space in the decentralized
5:26
product in a space that offered cover.
5:28
Uh this is where I'm uh going to give my
5:31
uh you know legal speech. This is not
5:33
but we we're not offering the insurance.
5:35
we are offering cover um that uh is paid
5:39
at the discretion of the mutual members.
5:42
So nexus is one this route where we
5:44
wanted to have some uh regulatory uh
5:47
clarity and we are a mutual that means
5:49
it's like a membership organization
5:51
where people come together pull funds
5:53
and um that's what we use to cover each
5:57
other basically. Um it's very much like
6:00
a DAO but with an actual legal structure
6:02
behind which is what makes this
6:04
structure quite quite appealing for us
6:06
and a good fit for crypto. Uh mutuals
6:09
have been around for many many hundreds
6:11
of years and probably a lot more people
6:14
became more aware of that with mass
6:16
mutuals um entrance in the space uh last
6:20
week. uh and having this uh mutual
6:24
approach in pulling funds together, we
6:26
manage to uh underwrite cover uh being
6:30
under collolateralized which uh as a
6:32
result makes the prices of the cover
6:35
that we sell very very competitive uh
6:38
compared to a product that would have to
6:40
be you know coll fully collaterized or
6:42
overly collaterized. Um just to give you
6:45
a a an idea the cover prices right now
6:50
start at 2.6% 6% a year for most of the
6:52
protocols that uh have been around for a
6:55
while and you know people consider to be
6:58
secure. Um and that's uh yeah that's one
7:02
of the key distinctions uh I'd say
7:06
that we have right now. At the same time
7:08
I just uh finish this one up really
7:10
quickly. At the same time having this
7:11
structure it allows us to scale
7:13
horizontally pretty well. uh so we can
7:16
start listing new new protocols uh quite
7:19
regularly and uh basically distribute
7:22
the the risk that we're managing
7:23
horizontally um as wide as possible.
7:27
Yeah. Yeah. Thank thanks a lot for that
7:29
answer. Do you want to talk a little bit
7:31
about how the bonding curve works and on
7:33
this this cover and how there has to be
7:36
like capital with that for people that
7:38
might be kind of unfamiliar?
7:40
Uh sure there are a couple of
7:42
components. One is the capital pool.
7:44
That's where all the uh assets of the
7:46
mutual sit into. Uh those m those assets
7:50
either come from people buying cover or
7:52
from people actually buying the token.
7:53
So basically supplying capital to the
7:55
mutual. Uh now the price of the token is
7:58
actually given by this bonding curve. Uh
8:01
so it's directly related to the assets
8:03
that we have in the pool. Uh and it's
8:06
designed for capital efficiency. What
8:08
does that mean? is that one when you
8:10
have little like being an you know
8:14
insurance kind of business you need a
8:16
minimum amount of capital to have to be
8:19
liquid in the mutual in order to pay out
8:21
claims if any events might occur. Um so
8:26
basically we always want to be a little
8:28
bit over that uh minimum capital that we
8:31
need to hold uh MCR some people who use
8:34
Nexus might be familiar with the term uh
8:37
so when we're getting very close to that
8:39
100% MCR so the uh the minimum capital
8:42
requirement then the price goes down
8:44
because that's a moment when we want to
8:46
get a bit more capital so we have you
8:47
know a bit of a buffer on top of that as
8:51
uh the capital in the pool grows much
8:53
larger than the minimum that we need,
8:55
the price goes up uh you know
8:58
exponentially on the curve. Uh and
9:00
that's basically giving the token
9:02
holders the opportunity to cash out on
9:04
some of the returns. Uh and it's a
9:07
statement because the price price goes
9:09
up uh it encourages people to sell and
9:11
it's a statement that we have too much
9:13
capital and we encourage people to exit
9:15
at that point because we we don't want
9:17
to keep idle capital in the mutual and
9:19
we want to be as efficient as possible
9:22
uh with that. So that's the the core
9:24
role that the bonding curve is playing
9:26
in in the picture.
9:28
Got it. Yeah, that makes it makes a lot
9:29
of sense. With
9:32
a lot of the the past few months, we've
9:34
seen a lot of different price oracle
9:36
attacks and uh different things
9:38
happening within
9:40
just DeFi and and blockchain in general.
9:43
Have you seen more people asking for
9:45
different insurance models and what what
9:47
is the focus to kind of help users for
9:50
these at Nexus Mutual? Uh right. Uh
9:54
we've definitely seen more people asking
9:56
around for cover. Um
9:59
one thing that uh the first product that
10:01
we offer right now is smart contract
10:04
cover and it actually uh only covers
10:07
users for smart contract bugs. So
10:09
anything that's external to the core
10:10
smart contract like an oracle attack or
10:12
a governance attack wouldn't be covered
10:14
in in our case. uh obviously with this
10:18
uh attacks increasing in the ecosystem
10:21
uh that's a core focus for us and one of
10:24
the products we're working on is more
10:26
comprehensive and would uh cover
10:30
uh more more types of risk including
10:32
Oracle uh Oracle failure. uh we're
10:35
thinking a lot about this problem
10:37
because obviously we are using oracles
10:39
ourselves uh and we also want to offer
10:42
protection for um any Oracle failures in
10:45
other systems. Um so yeah stay tuned for
10:49
beginning of 2021 in uh when we are
10:53
we're going to roll out the um yeah more
10:56
comprehensive race cover.
10:58
Cool. Yeah, very exciting times. It
11:00
feels like everyone in the space is kind
11:02
of coming together and you know solving
11:04
these these big challenges that weren't
11:06
there um weren't weren't able to be
11:09
solved a few few a few few months ago.
11:11
Uh you you kind of mentioned how Nexus
11:13
Mutual uses chain link and decentralized
11:16
oracles. How do how does that fit within
11:18
uh Nexus Mutual specifically?
11:22
uh we have this capital pool that I
11:24
mentioned before and at the moment we
11:27
hold mostly ETH and die uh but we can
11:30
add more assets this being actually one
11:32
of the main business models that
11:34
insurance companies adopt they uh invest
11:37
their pool of funds uh and in in this we
11:40
need a way to basically know what is the
11:43
total value of our pool in report to ETH
11:46
uh and that's uh where chain link comes
11:47
into picture it allows us to get the um
11:50
you
11:51
query the price feeds for any assets we
11:54
might hold and and get an overview of
11:55
where we stand. Uh and that's uh further
11:59
down used in things like the token
12:01
price, the cover uh amount that you uh
12:04
get and uh a few other pieces in the
12:06
system.
12:08
Got it. Okay, cool. Yeah, thanks thanks
12:10
a lot for that that answer. with uh
12:13
everything that's kind of happened, do
12:14
you have any personal opinions on some
12:17
of the the attacks of of price oracles
12:20
and different things that have happened
12:21
over the past couple months and any
12:23
thoughts or advice for developers that
12:26
might be starting new new projects?
12:29
Uh I think it's definitely a sign that
12:32
uh the stakes are getting higher. So
12:33
more more eyes are on these uh you know
12:36
assets that we hold in smart contracts.
12:39
uh which I think overall it's it's a
12:40
good thing that you know the space is
12:42
maturing and so on that also means a lot
12:45
of uh new developers are entering the
12:47
space um and I think first first of all
12:51
it's about you know following good
12:53
practices uh when it comes to um using
12:58
oracles and make sure
13:02
that if something can be manipulated
13:04
most likely it will be manipulated uh
13:07
and it's just a matter of time until
13:09
someone will figure out how uh there's a
13:12
lot of this debate around security
13:14
audits and uh you know what's their role
13:17
in in in the space and how they should
13:19
be done. I I definitely think they are
13:23
crucial and very important given the the
13:25
the stage we're at in in the whole like
13:27
Ethereum ecosystem.
13:29
um testing in prod is not something I'm
13:32
personally fond of and um I think teams
13:36
should take the responsibility that I
13:39
have seriously at the end of the day uh
13:41
we are directly responsible for the
13:43
funds that we hold for our users. Um
13:47
so I would love to see more and more um
13:52
education coming in the space first of
13:54
all and resources around how to design
13:56
good uh basically what are the best
14:00
practices when it comes to oracle uh
14:03
handling oracles in a system what are
14:05
the potential attacks like centralizing
14:07
all this information that people who've
14:09
been around for a while might know but
14:11
uh they're hard to discover for new
14:13
developers in the case
14:15
um having partnerships with auditing
14:18
firms or you know auditing uh like
14:20
security researchers in in general it
14:23
doesn't have to be you know
14:26
I think there are a lot of people in the
14:28
space that have the skill set to
14:30
actually uh help find these issues
14:32
before they go into mainet um so being
14:35
in touch with them with those
14:36
communities and getting audits um I
14:40
guess that's the minimum that everybody
14:42
should be should be looking
14:44
Yeah, that's that's very good advice and
14:45
very well said. With Nexus Mutual, we
14:49
kind of talked about how you're looking
14:50
to more more covers going forward in
14:53
2021. Is there anything else on your
14:54
product roadmap that that you all are
14:57
focused on?
14:58
Uh our big focus right now is um
15:02
distribution. Like we got to a point in
15:04
2020 where uh at the beginning of the
15:07
year, our main bottleneck was the amount
15:09
of capital that we have in the pool. um
15:11
the summer
15:13
helped us um get more capital. So now
15:17
it's on us to basically um sell more
15:20
cover and get uh get to the end users
15:23
that would benefit most from the
15:25
products we're offering. Uh so that's
15:27
the main thing we're focusing on right
15:29
now. Then it's uh rolling out new
15:32
products to cover uh different types of
15:35
risks that are not necessarily being
15:37
addressed right now. Um
15:41
and we have a a few more things in like
15:44
general focus on strengthening our core
15:46
incentives. We have to make sure that um
15:49
you know because it's such a close-knit
15:52
systems where we have the stakers that
15:54
have to provide capital to underwrite
15:56
the risk so people can buy cover. It's a
15:58
lot of a chicken and egg problem uh pro
16:01
problems that we have to solve. So we
16:03
need to make sure we iterate a lot on
16:05
the core mechanics until we get them
16:06
right. And I think as uh all uh whenever
16:10
it comes to incentives, you're always
16:12
going to get them wrong a couple of
16:13
times. Uh so we're in that space where
16:16
in that's uh a stage where we're
16:19
refining them and um uh hope to you know
16:23
get them better and um um that's yeah
16:27
that's the other big thing we're we're
16:28
focusing on. Uh and then finally there
16:31
are stuff around you know we have a a
16:34
pool of funds and uh is there any other
16:36
are there any other opportunities in uh
16:38
investing those funds so we can get more
16:41
um uh more capital for the like more
16:45
revenue more profit for the token
16:47
holders. Um and finally as always there
16:51
is a continuous focus on
16:52
decentralization. Uh and we are taking
16:55
active steps to basically decentralize
16:57
as many things as possible in uh hand as
17:01
much power as possible to the community
17:04
and driving the protocol forward.
17:06
Cool. Yeah. No, it sounds sounds sounds
17:08
very exciting what you have uh going
17:10
forward and really excited to see your
17:12
progress. Uh, is there before we kind of
17:15
wrap up here, is there anything else
17:17
that uh maybe we didn't talk about that
17:19
you wanted to to say to the audience or
17:21
or talk about?
17:24
Uh, good question. Um,
17:27
well, first of all, get in um get in
17:30
touch with us. We are on all sort of u
17:32
social uh channels. Um,
17:36
we are,
17:38
if you're interested, yeah, in finding
17:39
more, you can find us on our app, on
17:41
Twitter, on Discord, all that stuff. Um,
17:44
and I'm I'm really looking forward to
17:47
see how the Oracle uh space is
17:49
developing. I think you guys have been
17:51
doing a great job. Uh, and it is by far
17:54
the uh the best offering when it comes
17:58
to decentralized oracles. Uh, I think
18:00
it's a really really hard problem to to
18:02
get right. But um, and I'm looking I'm
18:05
really looking forward to see what sort
18:07
of uh new things you are going to do
18:09
over uh the next year. Um,
18:14
and yeah, I'm that's that's about it.
18:17
I'm uh I'm looking forward to uh 2021
18:21
like all of us.
18:24
I think so. I think that that year we we
18:26
well really appreciate what you just
18:27
said too and it's been fantastic working
18:29
with your team and uh it's crazy seeing
18:32
you know you you were one of the leaders
18:35
of starting this whole decentralized
18:36
insurance space and how far you've come
18:38
in such a short amount of time. So, it's
18:41
been fantastic working with your team
18:42
and really excited to see see your
18:44
growth as well.
18:46
Same uh same here. Um
18:50
yeah. Uh cool. Well, uh where can people
18:54
follow you? Uh do you do you have a
18:56
Twitter yourself?
18:57
Uh yeah, I'm on Twitter, Telegram, and
19:01
all sort of uh social channels at um Rox
19:05
Danilo. Um,
19:08
so yeah, happy to just follow along if
19:11
uh I can ask answer any sort of
19:13
