Nexxus we're basically trying to do the insurance part of the defy stack so
0:06
we're not actually insurance where people power it alternative that's that's what we're aiming to do might
0:14
like just go way way back because insurance is very very old its millennia
0:21
old it's basically groups of people coming together and sharing risk honor on a community basis and one of the I'll
0:31
start with a picture of this guy so this is a I guess a logo or an emblem it's
0:41
actually on the top of the first of the building that of the first insurance company I worked for and it's it's
0:47
really kind of shows what insurance is all about so what the picture is actually showing is a group of sticks
0:54
being held in a bundle and the man's trying to break to them and I don't know
0:59
if you've ever done this yourself but if you can you've got one stick you can easily break it yourself but if you put them together in a bundle and wrap them
1:05
up then it is incredibly hard to break so the whole point is that that's kind
1:11
of what Durance is about we grouped together as a society as a group of individuals and we protect each other
1:17
and we actually become stronger and more resilient as as a community and so I
1:22
guess one of the earliest examples of this is if we go back to to China and
1:28
then the river merchants would take their goods down the down the river and
1:34
basically they could lose all their goods because they capsized on it on the rapids or whatever so what they actually
1:40
used to do is they used to team up and share the load so they share some of
1:46
some of their own load they put on other people's boats and stuff so they'd share the risk together and then if one of
1:52
them lost the cargo then essentially they'd only lose the part of each and so
1:57
everyone was a bit more resilient and so that's kind of what this is all about insurance is essentially group of people
2:04
coming together and sharing risk and so we wanted one of the one of the challenges with that is that on a
2:10
community basis usually you kind of have to trust some group or subgroup of that
2:15
community to work out who pays claims or who decides what a valid claim is and one of the ways we used to do that is
2:23
essentially trust the elders in a community to decide and that works fine within that community but it often
2:29
struggles to scale so if you've got one community on one side of the hill and
2:34
another community and other side of the hill the people in one may not trust the elders of the other to pay on claims and
2:39
so you struggle to grow and so Mutual's have this inherent disadvantage that you
2:46
need a large groups of numbers and pooling of risk but they struggle to grow and so they struggle to becoming to
2:53
become efficient and so over time over many many years what has happened is that model has been replaced largely
3:00
with shareholder based insurance companies so what the shareholder
3:06
company does is essentially it bridges the people who want cover the individuals with capital markets and
3:13
capital needed to back the policies that have been written and and so essentially
3:19
they have their right right now they are the most efficient way we have of connecting capital markets with people
3:25
and that's what insurance is actually about so what our what our model is is
3:31
about creating this one or replicating this model at at scale allowing it to
3:36
scale up and compete with the big insurance companies in in the world on a mutual basis and and why would you want
3:43
to do that well essentially a mutual basis the whole thing is run for members by members and any benefits go to the
3:50
membership base so the money doesn't get taken by the shareholders it gets it gets distributed to the membership base
3:57
and so this is like this is essentially a dowel and so that's that's the type of
4:03
thing that we're that we're building or we've built so just very briefly what
4:13
we're building is what we call a decentralized risk area if you have a normal insurance company you've
4:19
essentially got customers or members at the top and they interact with the company and then you've got shareholders
4:24
and underneath if you have a today's Mutual you essentially have a very
4:33
similar structure it doesn't have any shareholders it just has members but there's essentially a company or a central organization that actually
4:38
decides on claims and operations and does the admin and sales and all that and so essentially the members kind of
4:45
outsource those responsibilities to a company and so it it has the benefits of
4:50
working for the membership base but there is a kind of a that tax in the middle or operational costs and there is
4:58
and there still that company well Nexus what we're doing is essentially devolving as much as
5:05
possible not absolutely everything but developing as much as possible to the membership based allowed them to run it to them to decide on claims them to work
5:12
out what the pricing is them to work out how to actually operate this on it on a day to day basis we use my contracts on
5:19
aetherium to do that so I kind of go through some of the more kind of
5:25
interesting aspects of some of the new stuff I guess we're doing and and one of those is we're actually a hybrid between
5:33
the company and a dower with illegally linked down and called whatever you want
5:38
we call we call it a digital cooperative in the with the the company model the
5:44
legal entity is here with the shareholders and the company and the members are outside that with a doubt
5:49
there's no legal of pure doubt there's no legal entity at all what we have done is create this legally
5:56
linked down so we have a legal entity in the UK and so if you join Nexus mutual as a member you actually become a member
6:03
of that membership organization in the UK and we have board members it's a
6:09
company and has to have board members and so some of those members are also board members of the company and they have slightly more powers in the system
6:16
than other members not as extreme as a regular company would but um but
6:21
to have that power and so just to kind of describe that a bit more we have what
6:30
we're setting it up is what's called a discretionary mutual in the UK so that's the the framework or the legal framework were operating under well in the
6:37
insurance side of things and the whole point there is that the members have discretion over which claims are being
6:43
paid and therefore it's not a contract of insurance so we are offering this
6:48
discretionary cover and so we have a company Nexus mutual limited it's a UK
6:54
Membership company it doesn't have any equity as I said before the H member joins the company they become a legal
7:01
member of the company and that means you have legal rights to the pool of funds that the mutual owns and also which are
7:09
kind of governed by tokens and so that actually means the token actually has legal rights which is interesting and
7:16
one of the main benefits that the two main benefits that we're actually doing this for one that it gives you limited
7:23
liability on a per member basis so if you're a member of a Dow and the Dow does something wrong then potentially
7:30
your unlimitedly legally liable for anything that the Dow does and someone could come after your house as an
7:36
example but here we've you get limited liability and we have a dowel that can
7:42
write a contract you can pay it you can get a bank account you can get us
7:48
someone to do some consulting work for you and do it and write an invoice and a service agreement and the contract
7:53
becomes a whole lot easier so that's that's kind of one of the benefits what
7:58
we're doing it is a company limited by guarantee thank you so more generally
8:10
insurance insurance exists so that other people can take risk
8:16
it basically underpins every industry in the world if you want to launch a rocket
8:21
you get insurance if you want to build a train line you get insurance if you only have you get a house you have insurance
8:28
like it's it's there it's it's always there it's kind of fundamental financial infrastructure it's so that we can we're
8:33
more resilient as a society and crypto doesn't have any access to insurance simple example we tried to get
8:42
insurance as a company regular insurance not crypto native insurance just regular
8:47
business type insurance we went to two brokers I kind of know what I'm doing the insurance world went to to Lloyd's
8:53
brokers I got twelve responses and they all look like this basically you have
9:02
something to do with blockchain or crypto and therefore the answer's no even though it's just regular business
9:07
insurance that's not actually it's not actually like cold world storage or anything like that it's not it's nothing like that it's just just regular
9:13
business insurance and they just said no we refuse to quote so we didn't even get it quote let alone able to place cover
9:20
and so we that's just a very simple example of just basic financial
9:26
infrastructure that this industry doesn't have access to and and so what that's actually a quite a good place to
9:34
start a mutual because the mutual is kind of a community do-it-yourself version of an insurance company and so
9:41
that's where we're focusing our first products on on crypto native risks and
9:47
getting into the product as you I'm sure most people here are aware there's a
9:53
whole bunch of hazards being locked in defy smart contracts as an example it
9:59
keeps going up apart from the value of ether slightly going down but we got
10:05
five hundred million and D five billion in multi-sig wallets we've got a whole bunch of dows coming online how many
10:11
Forks of Moloch are we going to end up with funding and stuff like that we've got payment channels got a whole bunch
10:17
of different things and obviously there's a technical risk that the smart contracts could fail and they could be hacked and so that's where our product
10:25
comes in smart contract cover the idea is that a claim is paid when or if there
10:33
is a unintended usage of the code that leads to financial loss so so one of the
10:39
interesting things is it's very code will always act as coded but it may not act as intended obviously like the the
10:46
DAO hack was an example no one like that code that to be able to be drained like no one thought that that was what the
10:51
intention of the code was but but that's what happened so so basically we have potentially a buggy smart contracts
10:58
holding lots of funds to me anything that's interesting on aetherium will actually either hold value or transmit
11:06
value and therefore it has the potential for being able to benefit from from
11:12
smart contract cover so that'sthat's our first product definitely focused on
11:17
crypto native risks we're exploring a few others but definitely think it's my
11:22
contract covers got a lot of a lot of potential I'll go through a couple of examples so I think in setup was talked
11:30
about bit recently allows you to flip assets between compound and maker quite easily to make the most efficient usage
11:37
of the interest rates etc they put a layer of smart contracts on top of compound and maker and so they're
11:45
actually holding recently about 30 million they haven't actually got an audit yet I'm not saying that there's
11:51
anything wrong with the contracts but it's basically two guys in India who done some really cool stuff and really
11:57
awesome stuff on the UX side but it may not necessarily have the money to get order I think some I think there's been
12:03
a crowd funder or someone's getting them and all it done now but but the point is
12:08
that there's a whole lot of money in this thing and it hasn't hasn't even had audit yet so we're kind of in some ways
12:15
running before we can walk but yeah another one edge where so this was an
12:22
interesting one you can you could or I'm sure if it's still going actually I think it's finished you can lock your
12:29
ether in the edge where's my contract so edge where is developing a pair of chain on on polka-dot and basically they're
12:37
using this as a signaling method to create an initial community and so what you do is you lock your ether up and you
12:44
earn a new edge where token when it launches and so they've got some i contracts it holds a lot of value a lot
12:53
of people quite happy to forego the opportunity cost of locking their ether up for 3 6 or 12 months in the return
12:59
for free it's free we're tokens and so there's two things
13:04
that they that you're actually losing out on there one's the opportunity cost of doing something else with the ether
13:10
and the second one is the technical risk of the smart contracts failing so interestingly on this one each we're
13:17
have actually got two lakh drop contracts the first lakh drop contract had a bug no one's funds were lost there was a
13:24
griefing attack where someone could actually work out where the I woke up the technical details but basically they
13:30
could lock your lock your funds in advance and someone realized this no one
13:35
lost their funds they deployed a new lock drop the contract and everything's fine but the point is this stuff's hard
13:41
I don't know I think they were just
13:48
talking just before these guys are building or have built a really fantastic mobile based wallet and one of
13:56
the main benefits of their approach is that it is my contract based which means
14:02
that you can do some really cool stuff like blocking having time delays and
14:08
things about setting up new accounts or who you send money to and making sure you've got a recovery process and and
14:14
also interacting natively with other Depot protocols like compound or maker or something and so the all this
14:21
intelligence and really smooth user experience is underpinned by smart contracts and so those smart contracts
14:28
are again holding holding use of funds so you've can you can do all this great stuff but in theory there's also a risk
14:35
that the smart contracts oh good good fail they've done a whole bunch of audits and you know they're very well
14:41
focused on security they're also looking to buy cover with us on a to give some
14:47
of their initial users some some cover and if you think about this more broadly
14:53
this is only really we're only really the start here but if you've got a smart
14:58
contract based wallet with all these features that looks like an online bank
15:04
account then you cover that with Nexus and all of a sudden it starts to very
15:10
look very similar to a bank account with FDIC insurance or the equivalent in the UK or Europe or
15:16
whatever so not a bank account not insurance but the same things the same
15:23
features from a from a user point of view where being real rebuilt in in the defy world so I'll just go into some of
15:32
the more specifics on how our product and the pricing and various other pieces
15:38
work so one question we always get obviously is how do you price the risk
15:44
of the smart contracts failing we have what we use we use a two-tier approach
15:50
to this so we have the first year being the hard-line is essentially the base algorithm and that roughly works out how
15:57
battle-tested the code is how long has it been on main edits held lots of funds
16:02
it hasn't been hacked therefore it's likely to be secure so so basically what happens is the price stuff stops really
16:08
really high possibly at a uncomfortable non-economic level and then it drifts
16:15
comes down over time as it gets more and more secure and then that doesn't work
16:21
for newly deployed contracts because they haven't been battle tested yet so you can't actually buy cover on them without the second tier and the second
16:28
tier is the staking process so what happens is as a member of Nexus you can
16:33
you can join Nexus as a member then you can buy as your token and then what you
16:40
can do is you can stake that token against specific smart contracts that you think secure so for example if you
16:47
think that the compound is secure then you can go and stake on compound and what happens is the price drops with
16:54
more more staking kind of like a prediction market not exactly the same but I'm kind of like a prediction market and then what happens is as a stake when
17:02
people buy cover you can get a share of the rewards over there you get a share
17:08
of the premium essentially in a commission so you become like a you can
17:14
become like a distributor as well and if there is a claim then some mistakes will
17:20
be will be burned so the mutual payout the claim and then burn stakes may equal to the claim value
17:26
as long as there's enough steaks so what happens with we're staking is the more
17:31
staking we have the lower the prices the more usable it is and the morning more capacity we have so our goal is to also
17:39
have a community of smoke contract auditors or skilled professionals we have a bunch of gamblers there right now
17:45
which is also useful but we are trying to get more and more auditors to get
17:50
more expertise behind this stuff so they can you know put their money where their mouth is and have some skin in the game
17:57
as well yep
18:05
so assuming there's no claim then essentially they get back their full stake and they in additional tokens and
18:15
the number of additional tokens they earn is based on how many people buy cover essentially another interesting
18:24
thing about what we're doing is we're one of the first live examples of a bonding curve model and their main the
18:33
main reason we actually have a bonding code we just step back like token if
18:39
we're creating a new token a lot of tokens just create a fixed supply it start on one extreme and then they never
18:46
create any more new ones for example and they raise a certain amount of capital
18:52
over start when one of the whole purposes of what a mutual knee actually needs to do fundamentally is get capital
18:58
in the mutual to back the policies that are rights and then as it writes more and more policies it needs to raise more
19:04
more capital to back them so in this a dynamic way of raising and distributing capital in the future no it does yeah so
19:23
the so essentially this is a mechanism of being able to attract new capital
19:29
when we the mutual needs it and to encourage it to be redeemed when we have excess capital so what happens is we
19:38
essentially the the pricing is more or less primarily driven in the short-term by this MC our percentage and
19:45
the MCA is like the minimum capital requirement or the ratio or the minimum capital so it's basically the ratio of
19:51
the funds held actually in the mutual funds that it actually has versus the funds at 1/8 and so the funds that it
19:58
needs is basically worked out on what which covers it's written so if it
20:03
writes more more covers it needs more and more funds and so let's turn to your point that's we have a formula which
20:29
determines the capital that we need based on the policies that we have that is based on the principles of insurance
20:35
regulation so we've base it off the solvency tooth calculations and so that's essentially the calculation of
20:40
how much we need then there's the market side of it which is how much the mutual
20:46
actually has in it which is up and down yes so the ratio as a end result can be
20:52
up and down based on micro perceptions but we also ensure that the mutual always has enough funds to be able to
20:58
make itself so we basically restrict you can't cash out your tokens unless we
21:03
have excess funds so the bonding curve allows purchases at any time but you
21:08
can't cash out your token unless we have more than our minimum amount and so
21:14
basically what happens is over time as we write more and more policies this minimum capital requirement becomes a bigger and bigger number and then it
21:21
will put a dampening effect on the token price to encourage more people to put money in and then the whole thing grows
21:28
assuming we as an example assuming we just stay at a constant level just
21:34
writing covers and they go on and go off at the same rate and we just kind of roughly at the same size the minimum capital we need is stays constant then
21:41
what happens is the policies that keep getting purchased essentially leave a
21:47
surplus in the pool along with the investment earnings of the asset pool that we've got
21:53
and that means overtime assuming we don't need any more capital then the ratio just keeps climbing and climbing
21:58
assuming no one's cashing it out then it keeps pushing the price up and up and up because profits or surpluses are being
22:04
made by the mutual reinsurance and
22:25
insurance basically the same thing so this you could mimic this model yes it
22:57
has similarities we've probably not exactly the same but it does have similarities no no they did yeah that
23:05
this it makes a lot kind of range it's not kind of reinsurance in some ways the the staking is kind of like as a as a
23:12
token holder you're essentially taking diversified arees against all the covers that the mutual rights just sharing risk that's the whole point as a stake iran a
23:20
specific smoke contracts you're kind of doubling down your risk you're saying I'm taking that diversified risk that I
23:25
want to double down on this one I think it's good to enhance your return so that's what you do so yeah so that
23:33
that's kind of the bonding curve model and say the funding curves live right
23:38
now you can purchase tokens if you want to cash them out if you want to you can get involved and so yeah so I guess I've
23:48
described this in a bit more detail already but but essentially if you know
23:53
you nice well as a liquidity provider this has a lot of conceptual similarities a few differences obviously
24:00
but but conceptually it's the same type of thing so basically you contribute ether into the capital pool
24:07
you get tokens in return so it's kind of like a liquidity provider in uni swap and then as people purchase cover and
24:13
surplus is generated that surplus remains in the pool and is essentially owned by the token holders and so you
24:20
essentially share share in that and so the mutual members are the token holders basically own all assets in the capital
24:26
pool and that's that's how it makes money yes they have to be so yes sir
24:40
there's a whitelist approach there's a whitelist and okay oh I see and so the first step is you become a member of the
24:45
company just pay a very small membership fee and then you have the ability to buy tokens and the tokens can only reach
24:51
traded amongst the members so there's a trading restriction and so basically we are creating a mutual company that's so
25:00
the token is quite different to regular tokens but you can buy the tokens directly from our application on the
25:06
bonding curve and you can sell them wishing me move out access access funds you can sell them at any time as well so
25:14
yeah so quite a few unique differences to out on our token versus I've guessed
25:20
standard tokens if there is such a thing as a standard token yep so let's go a
25:31
quick demo a bit account because the Wi-Fi but better say it's live now you can go and have a look you can get a
25:37
quote you don't even have to connect me to my scope to get a coin so basically all you have to do is enter the smart
25:43
contract address that you would like covered for the system how much cover you would like and how long you want
25:49
cover for and you get a quote and go from there and if you'd like to proceed then you sign up obviously one of the
25:55
tricky things is how do I know it's my contract address so we've set up in its
26:00
name so if you want to get cover on make it out then you type in make it our CD
26:06
dodd nexus mutual either and then that gives you the quote for make it down and there's a whole bunch of other ones
26:12
there as well so i guess two points you can buy cover but denominated in ether
26:18
and you or you could buy it in die so for example if you want to get cover
26:24
and make it out you've probably got ether locked up and make it our smart contracts or may make sense to buy ether
26:29
based coverage if you're putting dye into compound then you won't want to buy a dive ace coverage because that's your
26:34
risk so so you can choose either of those two options and in the in the
26:40
event of a claim you get basically get paid your whole the cover amount you chose so there's no check that you
26:47
bought ten thousand died worth of cover and you'll only lost five thousand so you still get the full ten thousand of
26:53
claim there's no check about your individual loss yeah so you can gamble
26:59
in it if you don't do so yeah so that's that's basically that's basically us and
27:05
a quick ways through of what we're doing and the interesting parts more broadly there's a kind of alluded to before defy
27:12
is kind of you know how opinion building a parallel financial infrastructure and as part of that you need you need
27:20
insurance and so we think that this is this is fundamental financial infrastructure for a new economy and
27:26
that's what we're we're trying to provide okay thank you question yeah all
27:41
right this is great and I've sort of looked at this for a while I just won't
27:46
worry that I have is is slightly that you've found a very good way of setting up an unregulated insurance company of a
27:53
want of a better term funded by crypto which is good but I'm worried about the
27:59
product you're writing because smart contracts insurance is is basically binary I mean either it's a UH Turley
28:05
catastrophic total loss type situation where everyone gets wiped out or
28:11
everything's fine it's a hundred or zero and that's a tricky risk to write in
28:17
insurance I think and and I wonder to myself if it wouldn't be better a more
28:23
hybrid approach or because you have a pool of capital and you can write insurance effectively to sort of write
28:29
insurance on traditional pools of capital yourself a little bit like
28:34
like a lloyd syndicate if that makes sense or being part of a lloyd syndicate
28:39
or writing on stuff that's in the current real world rather than going the
28:45
extra step and writing smart contract insurance when smart contracts themselves are so binary yeah sure so
28:52
there's two things there that first the the binary type risk the way we manage
28:57
that is essentially we put capacity limits on any particular spun contract so we can only write for example
29:04
capacity and compound up to 20 percent or anything else up to 20 percent of the assets to be hold so to make sure that if there is an
29:10
event then we've got enough money to pay so that's the way we manage that and at
29:15
the moment with max down on compound as an example so we need to grow further for more capacity to open up so that's
29:21
the way we manage that risk so we have to grow what I say I call it growing horizontally before growing vertically
29:27
vertically we have to get diversification across difference my contracts before we can start growing in
29:36
size and then oh that opens up capacity on everything secondly this is a very
29:43
crypto native platform to actually use you need ether you need meta mask you need dye or something so these are this
29:50
is for crypto natives right now the economic the crypto I guess basic
29:56
infrastructure for fear on and off ramps and all that type of stuff is not quite there yet it's not quite smooth and so
30:02
what we discovered through research was that the number of people that wanted regular insurance products and had
30:07
crypto was - so we built a product for
30:13
crypto natives that was covering crypto native risks that they couldn't get covered elsewhere so the regular
30:18
insurance industry is nowhere near offering this type of cover and so they basically only have this option and so
30:23
that's we believe with at the early stages of product like a fit for this
30:29
for this product so as long as we can manage the risk appropriately then we
30:34
think this is the way forward in the future we plan to stay crypto native
30:39
risks for a while get scale but if you want to target more regular insurance products you need a certain level of
30:45
scale to be shouldn't be offering those types of products so we need to get that scale first that we can get that within crypto
30:51
native first for pricing the size of
31:00
cover is it only the value that's being locked in the smart contractor are you also pricing the risk of Oracle's and
31:05
sort of ambiguous aspects yeah so there actually I categorize the risks in
31:11
interacting with a smart contract into three buckets and we basically cover one of them that there's the technical risk
31:18
of the smart contracts failing which is what we cover then there's the centralized admin oracle external
31:25
basically external to the system type stuff right so we don't cover that right
31:31
now but I think that's pretty impossible to cover actually if we did then someone
31:36
could just attack the system essentially you're insuring some random guy on the internet is going to behave as you want
31:41
which is really hot and then the the third one is economic incentive failure
31:48
which is a bit more ambiguous for example if the Baker does Interest Rate
31:55
Mechanism doesn't work and the die peg fails then you know die may be worthless
32:01
but the smart contracts was still operate as intended so we don't cover that one yet but I see that that's
32:07
there's potential for us to be able to cover that stuff in the future but we need to be more experienced first just
32:14
just a simple question around where one can go to look at price nxm rates
32:20
returns is that it's not on your website right now is it publicly or there's a
32:25
network status page on the dashboard okay gives you the bunt current Bundy curve price and you can just see you can
32:33
see the full essence of the mutual the covers that have been written and the current price okay can I came in maybe a
32:39
little late so I'm a missus can you walk through like some just numbers on like what a typical participant can earn like
32:45
a simple example where where there's great rates of return right now where
32:51
there's less yeah it's like we don't have the numbers right now we're really quite early most of the users actually
32:57
using it for buying bank cover and that's the main purpose of the whole thing if you want to get involved and
33:04
the I mean to be honest that the mutual is still quite early so it's really not
33:10
kind of had that stage where it's spinning off material surplus right at the moment so it's really people in
33:16
getting involved from a longer-term perspective right now yes okay the front
33:25
and their guy Steve yeah just so just a quick question on the your approach to
33:30
customers and we had argent in here very viously and clearly use case there are
33:35
you looking at this as a product that you directly or that is directly accessible to end-users or something
33:41
that is typically packaged up through an argent or insurance is always a secondary product like you don't go yeah
33:48
I want insurance you go I want to put money in compound I want that covered or I want to put money in argent or that
33:53
covered or you know so so we by nature that secondary purchase so therefore we need to work with the distribution
34:00
channel which is the primary purchase yeah and so there's two main angles there one is the kind of business to
34:07
business side of things which is all about partnering with smart contract security experts where new projects
34:14
developing smart contracts they're looking to release they want to give confidence to early users they want to
34:19
buy cover on their own smart contracts to give a safety net and encourage early adoption and that kind of comes through
34:25
the security auditors face and then there's the other group which is primarily where a sales coming from right now which is kind of the end users
34:32
of defy and they're just they're just going into compound make a new o dy/dx
34:38
fulcrum all that type stuff putting their assets in earning returns and then coming and also buying cover because
34:43
they're worried rather technical risk yeah and sorry I did have a follow on which is just related to that the
34:48
compliance around new user onboarding and I guess you're working with unregulated tokens today they might not
34:55
be regulated for that much longer in some cases in the event that there is a
35:01
kyc type requirement that you need to comply yeah and you have a plan for how
35:06
that would be addressed or don't we have KYT right now for individual end-users
35:12
okay question answer their names yeah Steve gee you kind of mentioned
35:22
earlier on about kind of the possibility obviously of developing independently
35:29
from you know the traditional insurance well when do you see the kind of would there be a crossover at any point where
35:35
for example you talked about lloyd syndicates and they may be they may see you know putting some money in nxm as a
35:43
great you know way of diversifying their risk or getting it getting exposure to this kind of risk that they don't
35:49
actually have themselves is there is there a future where you see that kind of happening and is it soon or is it 10
35:55
years time yeah so I see this I see this two main options on that front firstly
36:02
the regular insurance industry is very risk-averse their business is risk but
36:08
they're very risk-averse and so they will likely enter crypto native risks via someone else and hopefully that's
36:15
via us and so in in the way that it might enter is by actually providing
36:21
reinsurance or excessive loss coverage on top of our pool and wheat and the mutual takes the first layers of risk
36:27
and we use that extra reinsurance type capital to scale up and off more capacity to others but they're not going
36:33
to do that until they've seen a few claims being paid they understand how it works and all the rest of it and so
36:39
maybe that's two years away having conversations now but you know both
36:44
these things take a while yeah exactly
37:00
that's how they do it yeah I'd say there's some business line of existing disciplines I'm kind of asking a full of
37:08
a question I mean literally if you had a two competing ecosystems one that's truly crypt another one that's
37:14
traditional the traditional will be efficient in the sense of okay so there is no chance that in an open market in a
37:21
reinsurance market where the market prices of smart contracts either risk assess wire a betting market
37:28
or some other mechanism that you will have any chance do you see of any ways of reducing your cost so there's two
37:35
things for efficiency a permanent insurance point of view once the administrative costs and the other one's
37:42
the capital efficiency so obviously right now we're quite small and so any regular player would absolutely dominate
37:49
us from a capital efficiency point of view but they're not entering the market that don't don't have the expertise so we have some time to grow from an admin
37:57
point of view we estimate there were at least fifty percent cheaper on a cost
38:03
base reverse as a regular insurer so and that's because we're basically a ignore
38:10
blockchain we're basically a like a green fields fully automated end-to-end insurance company so like that there are
38:19
- there are two sides to it we need to grow first to make sure we can't compete on the capital efficiency side of things
38:26
so just on the the trading of individual contracts like the TC ours so you said
38:33
that once it gets to the minimum required capital it's sort of effectively like gates so assuming there
38:39
was like a breach I could sell out of that before other people and then those people would be
38:45
locked and wiped out so I could like build sorry so yeah basically there's a
38:52
claim that's been submitted the mutual has to pay out send them out and then
38:57
but and then people want to cash out turn to the minimum yeah so yes entirely
39:03
possible but the primary purpose of the tokyo model is to make sure we have
39:08
enough money to pay genuine claims and so what happens in that is it prevents the sale of like the bank run can't go
39:14
the whole way because the my contracts prevent it and we make sure that we pay the claim and then what happens is the
39:20
token price would drop a bit further because we have a bit less money and that encourages people to to essentially
39:26
free refill the capital so there's yes that is new we haven't actually paid
39:33
claim yet so we hit you know if this has to be tested but that's what the the the
39:39
primary purpose of it to make sure we have enough money to pay claims right but yes so I guess my question was it wouldn't freeze and ever
39:46
want to be wiped out like 80 percent the people that exit would be out and clear but everyone else to get 100% wiped out
39:54
right no you so you couldn't sell as soon as you read the news before it was
40:00
gated so right right now as an example
40:05
right now our MCI ratios is 130 percent so we have 30 percent excess funds and
40:13
so so we have basically nine thousand ether and we need seven thousand ether in the pool and so two thousand ether of
40:20
that could be sold at any point so that could be essentially front-run when you know that there's a potential claim then
40:26
it stops at seven thousand and say the claim is for one thousand ether then the claim payment goes through it drops to
40:31
6,000 the claims paid and the token price goes down to whatever it's supposed to be at 6,000 and because it's
40:38
lower the theory is that it will encourage more people to recapitalize back up right
40:44
but wouldn't be fairer if like the same compound came to you and said look we think we've got a breach and then you
40:50
like locked up everyone and everyone you know paid the same price you know then
40:55
we'd also have control over the system yeah
41:01
you walk through the process yep so so basically the claims process from a
41:08
customer point of view is if you think there's been an event you go into the system do one transaction it puts a
41:15
event into the kind of voting pool so the other members vote on the claims
41:21
assessment and there's a staking process there so if you want to be a claims Assessor then you stake the native token
41:26
there's a kind of bond and then if it reaches the 70 percent majority
41:33
threshold say it's been approved then the claim gets paid and the claims does
41:40
is a share of the rewards for a particular claim and we make sure that there's enough bond so that it's there's
41:49
at least five times the amount of bond as per the claim amount that's being approved so that you can't like bribe
41:56
people and to approve your claim and then pay them back so yeah so it's that's the basic mechanism there's a
42:02
little bit more detail to it but done that's the basic thing catism so you
42:09
should be resolved within a maximum of 48 hours
42:21
is there a sort of what we used to call CBS risk where basically you can sort of
42:29
take out insurance on someone else's house and then burn it down sort of things so where where basically you can
42:35
know that you can blow up a smart contract get insurance on it blow it up
42:40
and sort of profit effectively and in the way that c.d.s used to work in in the 2008 crisis sort of yeah if there's
42:49
a bug in it already yeah if this is zero
42:57
day that no one else is discovered for some period of time then yes well if the
43:05
zero day has been sitting there for a period of time and people haven't noticed it then yes however if you knew
43:12
that then you'd attack the system and potentially drain the money in the first place anyway so yes there's no yeah well like you can
43:25
just still attack the whole thing in the first place yeah if you got a hundred
43:31
million sitting in compound then you can make an extra few hundred thousand on Nexus then they just go for compound to
43:37
do it first yeah I totally great you
43:43
know there is that potential there but the whole thing is like the whole it won't be comfortable without staking
43:51
unless it's paint battle-tested stake
44:06
yeah basically one of two things have happened though new to my contract comes
44:12
out here there has to be battle testing with funds and usage etc and that comes
44:17
down over time or what and or or they're staking enough staking to bring it down
44:23
and if they're staking then you pay the claim and burn the stake and it's kind of a net net
44:37
have that have you done any kind of you know thoughts calculations around like
44:44
potentially obviously there's a risk pool there that can potentially earn a return earn a kind of relatively safe
44:51
inverted commas return if you're kind of utilizing that and various other defy
44:57
kind of aspects I'm assuming that that is also a surplus that would accrue to
45:03
the in nxm token holders over time yeah so insurance companies make most half a
45:09
chunk of their money from pending asset any returns on the float so to pull the
45:15
vests it's that they have and that's why Warren Buffett buys insurance companies
45:20
so he can invest the float in other things and just double up so anyway so
45:26
we've enabled that right now it's not actually active at the moment the pool just holds ether and died but it's set
45:32
up to hold neer c20 and so you could for example allocate some of the the asset
45:39
pool to like sea die or to fulcrum die I died I think I know
45:44
anyway the different interest bearing assets and maybe not I'm assuming the
45:50
broker pool or getting home with a proof mistake token once the 2.0 goes live and so we could invest in assets like that
45:56
which are perfect for employment for insurance like companies because they are relatively low risk of default but
46:04
they just provide a yield and so it's fully enabled to do that it's not currently active right now
46:18
when you invest in compound you're not going to get the C die or the die back until the user reimburses the loan or
46:25
pays back their loan yeah so so we have a we have two pools of assets so we have
46:30
there's a whole group of assets and when we have two sub pools one is the the quiddity pool which is basically cash
46:36
and that is dine to pay out claims from and then just like an insurance company you actually hold a liquid assets but
46:42
you have to make sure you don't held too many illiquid assets and because we work the way actually works is if a claim
46:48
comes in and we know we don't have enough in the liquid asset pool to pay that claim if it was to eventuate we
46:54
still have 20 at least 24 hours before the voting finalizes so we send off trades to uni swap to rebalance the pool
47:01
so we have enough liquid assets to pay the claim yeah so we want to make sure that we can invest in the illiquid
47:07
assets but we also want to make sure that we can pay claims well yeah so we
47:16
have yeah that that is definitely what's one of the reasons we haven't actually enabled the investing stuff yet because
47:23
for example if we were to hold C died then we're essentially accumulating risk
47:29
because we're providing cover and like if the whole thing goes down so we have to like it may make sense as an example
47:34
to hold I don't only like fulcrum us DC
47:40
or something that you know it's a bit I don't know what the answer is right now but we have to be cognizant of that
47:45
accumulation of risk when we add assets to the pool
47:56
yeah except that pools non-custodial so we're only holding ERC 20s and the whole
48:02
point is that no one has access to the funds of the mutual that's one of the key key points yeah I don't Tommy's we
48:16
can is there any more question so you Scott no okay thank you [Applause]
