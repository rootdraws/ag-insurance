all right we'll give it a second
0:10
all right there we go we're live cool
0:12
hey so welcome everyone
0:14
uh this is a new segment i'm going to be
0:17
experimenting with called d5 talks with
0:19
d5 dad
0:20
uh this will be hosted on my youtube
0:22
channel at d5dad.com
0:24
uh the goal is just to be able to uh hit
0:28
upon
0:28
uh some of the you know the biggest news
0:32
events in d5
0:33
um to be able to screen share with uh
0:36
founders that are building the future of
0:38
d5 and so
0:40
today seemed like a good day to to kick
0:42
this off
0:43
we've got hugh carp who is the the
0:45
founder of nexus mutual
0:46
nexus mutual is the leading provider of
0:49
i would call it defy insurance but it's
0:51
more properly called cover
0:53
it allows you to protect the value of
0:56
your assets
0:57
in different d5 protocols whether you're
0:59
on ethereum or now on any chain
1:02
and we're going to talk all about uh
1:04
what this new protocol cover
1:06
offers and uh yeah hugh just excited to
1:10
have you thanks for
1:11
for joining me um how's it going
1:14
yeah i know it's great to be here um
1:16
thanks oh yeah i'm
1:17
excited to um give a go of your new your
1:20
new stream um
1:20
yeah exciting day for us um at nexus so
1:23
yeah a big a big product update it's
1:25
been it's been great
1:26
yeah yeah and to uh to clarify uh yield
1:29
tv isn't going anywhere uh
1:31
just uh there are lots of conversations
1:34
that i have
1:35
outside of the scope of yield tv that
1:38
i've always wanted to um
1:40
host conversations around and uh so this
1:43
is it
1:44
you know we'll be uh hopefully doing
1:45
some more ad hoc
1:47
uh discussions and if you ever have
1:49
ideas or there's topics you'd like to be
1:51
covered
1:52
um just shoot me a message on twitter
1:55
also though i would remind you to check
1:56
out yieldtv
1:58
tv.zapper.phi and yeah
2:01
otherwise we'll get right into it hugh
2:03
um in case anyone is new to nexus
2:06
why don't we talk about what's your
2:08
background um like when did you start
2:10
nexus
2:11
and maybe you could help them to come up
2:14
to speed on
2:15
on what's the mission behind nexus
2:18
yeah so um whirlwind tour i'm i'm a
2:21
i'm an insurance professional i'm an
2:23
actuary i've been doing insurance stuff
2:25
for a long time 15 years before doing
2:28
starting nexus um and i guess
2:31
i um i got really interested in the in
2:33
the tech um like bitcoin and i'm being
2:36
able to
2:36
pay people without anyone else in the
2:38
middle and that's kind of what really
2:40
i'm drew me in um but but then
2:44
we had ethereum launch and i guess
2:46
that's when it really clicked for me
2:47
because if you could write an if-then
2:50
statement
2:50
then you could essentially do an
2:52
insurance contract and
2:54
if we had technology to coordinate
2:56
people
2:57
especially around financial incentives
2:59
then that's basically just an insurance
3:01
company
3:02
it's a group a group of people sharing
3:04
risks together and deciding how they
3:05
share that pot of money or what they do
3:07
with that pot of money
3:08
um and insurance is always
3:12
fundamentally about a community sharing
3:14
risk with each other
3:16
it's about people sharing risk with each
3:17
other um and so
3:20
big shareholder based insurance
3:22
companies have come in because that's
3:24
actually the most efficient way we have
3:26
of sharing risk amongst communities
3:27
right now
3:28
but i guess nexus's philosophy is that
3:31
now we have this new
3:32
tech that can do it in a much more
3:34
efficient way and just coordinate the
3:35
people directly
3:36
rather than rely on the um centralized
3:39
entity with all of its
3:41
fat and excess
3:44
i guess you know waste within the system
3:46
i guess is what we're trying to strip
3:47
out
3:48
and bring it right back down to the
3:49
community driven incentives
3:51
and if we can do that we can really make
3:54
it scale and we can really do this
3:56
on a global scale and actually have
3:58
people coordinate together
4:00
on a global global scale and just do it
4:03
hum themselves
4:04
and and so nexus's vision is to
4:06
basically become
4:08
the decent centralized version of lloyds
4:10
of london where anyone can coordinate
4:11
together and
4:12
and share risk doesn't matter what it is
4:14
um right now we're focusing on crypto
4:16
risks but
4:17
it could be anything in the future could
4:18
be real world stuff earthquakes
4:19
hurricanes
4:21
home auto all that type of yeah um you
4:23
know that we're a fair way of that to be
4:25
honest but um you know as we're
4:27
progressing towards it and we've got a
4:29
strong vision to try and get there
4:31
so the the most important update i think
4:34
that's
4:35
uh come today with protocol cover is
4:37
that
4:38
you've added more comprehensive coverage
4:41
uh and i don't know why i say
4:43
you have i'm a part of the nexus mutual
4:45
community too so like
4:46
uh you know par i've i've always thought
4:48
that you know nexus is one of the most
4:50
important projects for us to be able to
4:52
grow in d5
4:53
because if you can buy cover
4:56
you know that you can at least risk i
4:59
think larger amounts of money
5:00
that you would that you um uh would
5:04
put into defy otherwise so like an
5:06
example
5:07
you know i can speak personally to the
5:09
fact that you know i was very
5:11
careful about how much i might have put
5:13
into ave
5:14
uh you know a year and a half ago um
5:17
i think i'm still a little bit cautious
5:19
you know with any d5 protocol
5:21
but i know that i can risk more for for
5:23
my own portfolio because of the fact
5:25
that
5:26
i always have cover through nexus and i
5:29
know that there's a track record of
5:30
nexus pain out that cover
5:32
but what's changed uh we used to talk
5:34
about is it a bug
5:36
you know and what is a bug and what does
5:38
that mean whether smart contracts were
5:40
used in a way that
5:41
they were not intended to be used now
5:44
you have what oracle failures covered
5:47
financial exploits or flash loan attacks
5:51
anyways can you summarize what's the new
5:54
cover
5:55
uh definition yeah yeah yeah
5:58
so so basically um their original
6:01
product was designed basically after
6:03
we'd seen just the dow hack and the
6:04
parity multisig
6:05
wallet issues which were pretty much
6:07
just like coding error
6:09
bugs um protocols didn't work as
6:11
intended and obviously d5 has
6:13
expanded and um done a whole lot more
6:17
more stuff over the past few years and
6:18
risks have grown
6:20
and changed and all the rest of it so
6:22
protocol cover
6:23
is an updated version of smart contract
6:24
cover and it replaces the old product
6:26
and it's much more comprehensive
6:28
so rather than just covering the smart
6:30
contract bugs
6:31
basically you know that shouldn't have
6:33
been able to get in there and drain all
6:35
the money straight away just by a simple
6:36
exploit
6:37
it also covers things like oracle
6:39
manipulation so where you push the
6:42
price oracle off to some extreme and
6:44
then exploit the
6:45
protocol in a kind of economic fashion
6:47
it also covers
6:49
um economic attacks where the economic
6:52
um incentive mechanisms fail in an
6:55
extreme way that leads to
6:57
um your funds that are in the protocol
6:59
being stolen or
7:01
i'm taken and the other one is actually
7:05
governance attacks we haven't really
7:06
seen one of these yet but say that
7:08
there's
7:08
um a group of people that managed to
7:12
maliciously alter the system and then
7:14
extract some of the funds
7:15
out of the system as a result of that
7:17
then that's something that we also cover
7:19
and so but the first part of protocol
7:21
cover is really this
7:22
expansion from um
7:25
from just the smart contract bugs to
7:28
also cover
7:29
these other um risks actually maybe a
7:32
better question is what is not covered
7:34
like what's some examples uh i know uh
7:38
for example if there is a rug pool
7:41
uh you know you wouldn't be covered what
7:43
happened with
7:44
sin love i think was the name of it like
7:47
that wouldn't be covered
7:48
what happened with uh easy fi
7:51
recently that wait a sec would that be
7:54
covered
7:55
either that would that wouldn't be
7:56
covered no um but yeah
7:58
that's that's the one that is the one
8:00
thing that would that's not covered
8:02
that's yeah we've designed we've
8:03
designed the protocol to try and
8:05
basically cover all the extreme events
8:07
but we have to specifically exclude
8:08
rogue pools
8:09
and that's basically where um someone or
8:12
some key
8:13
controls access to the funds um some
8:16
administrative function
8:18
and so regardless of whether that team
8:20
did it or
8:21
the key was hacked and um and somebody
8:24
else did it regardless of how
8:26
that might happen that type of attack um
8:28
is excluded
8:29
it's just unfortunately it's just a
8:31
massive moral hazard
8:32
um it's it's yeah you can exploit nexus
8:35
as a system
8:36
yeah you could incentivize founders to
8:39
it to
8:40
do a rug pull and then collect uh having
8:43
bought cover through
8:44
through nexus i think to caveat that
8:47
though like
8:48
let's say um let's say that someone's
8:53
funds are just locked
8:54
you know there it's not an actual rug
8:56
pool there are some terms in there to
8:58
cover you for that right because
9:00
with okay so custodial cover had been
9:02
launched a while ago
9:03
if i have my assets in coinbase or let's
9:07
say binance
9:08
and i can't withdraw them for 90 days
9:11
then
9:11
then i'm i'm covered right i can
9:13
actually get a payout because
9:15
that's the point of custodial cover with
9:17
this new protocol cover that is
9:19
specifically for d5 protocols um
9:22
are there any terms like that if your
9:24
funds are just locked let's pretend it's
9:25
not a
9:26
a rug pool but for some reason they're
9:28
not allowing you to withdraw your funds
9:31
yeah so um basically proof of loss means
9:34
you actually lost funds someone took
9:35
them
9:36
out or the funds are permanently
9:38
irrecoverable
9:39
um so you know but either way they're
9:42
lost and you can't access them so that
9:44
that that counts yeah yeah and then um
9:47
uh one last point to make on all this is
9:49
i'm trying to you know navigate this
9:52
with your guidance but at the end of the
9:54
day the way these will be voted upon is
9:56
or the way it gets decided is there's
9:58
the terms the community has agreed upon
10:00
but nexus is run by a dow
10:02
so you know it comes down to nxm holders
10:05
you know voting on is this covered or
10:07
not um what i think what's
10:09
the real like advancement here is you've
10:11
made the terms
10:13
i mean much more comprehensive and i
10:15
think it's easier
10:16
to understand what is covered whereas
10:19
before
10:20
we we all have had these discussions of
10:22
well is that a bug is it not a bug is it
10:25
covered by this by the terms that have
10:27
been laid out
10:28
um as a community um so this is this is
10:31
huge to me like it is
10:33
it is the difference between having um
10:36
you know if i bought liability insurance
10:38
for my car
10:39
versus comprehensive this is us going to
10:42
that more comprehensive level with
10:44
protocol cover yeah exactly and like you
10:47
know
10:47
out the whole default space has evolved
10:49
and we need to evolve with it basically
10:51
so that's that's
10:52
that's the big story here yeah um so
10:54
i've got your screen up here could you
10:56
walk us through
10:56
uh just you know we don't have to buy
10:59
cover
11:00
live but if someone's new if they go to
11:03
uh
11:04
yeah i'll i'll pick a picture there we
11:06
go
11:07
just because it's interesting because
11:08
it's um they can
11:10
um it's got lots of chains so um so
11:13
basically
11:14
you just pick the protocol that you want
11:16
some cover against and then you can
11:18
choose how much color and you can choose
11:20
in ether or die so this is basically
11:23
what you would get paid if there was a
11:26
hack so say you're putting some
11:28
um some stable coins in um
11:31
sushi swap then you can buy um a
11:33
thousand
11:34
dive worth of coverage and you can
11:36
choose to buy for say 90 days
11:38
um in in any days and then you can get a
11:40
quote over here
11:42
um and you can purchase it in die or you
11:45
can purchase it in nxm
11:47
um so i won't go ahead and do that now
11:49
but i think
11:50
um i think one of the interesting just
11:52
going through the terms and conditions
11:54
you can see that
11:54
controversies i mean a lot of economic
11:57
attacks
11:58
we've got oracle failures and governance
12:00
attacks and
12:01
the the one of the really cool things
12:03
that um which is why i brought up sushi
12:05
swap actually
12:06
is all of a sudden we are now covering
12:09
um sushi swap on all of these chains
12:13
so if you are interacting with sushi
12:16
swap on either ethereum finance smart
12:18
chain
12:18
xdi phantom or polygon um we cover
12:22
that so um it's not not only are we
12:26
um covering a wider um array of risks
12:28
but we're also covering um
12:30
protocols running on different chains
12:33
uh hugh can you zoom in on those terms
12:36
by the way if you just
12:37
think they'll be able to see it
12:46
here we go is that a bit better
12:48
hopefully that's a bit better
12:49
very cool there we go yeah wow yeah a
12:52
lot lot has been added there
12:54
as opposed to what was just the contract
12:56
bugs before
12:57
um and this is so you don't show
13:00
solana here but if uh someone launched
13:03
on solana or
13:05
cosmos like that's also covered polka
13:07
dot
13:08
basically everything under the sun as
13:10
long as nexus
13:12
is um offering cover for them
13:15
uh in the in the front end here then
13:17
then we should have that cover on any
13:19
chain
13:20
yeah that's right we're just trying to
13:21
provide more clarity about exactly what
13:23
what's covered and all the rest of it so
13:24
we list it in the ui but yeah it covers
13:26
any chain that's correct
13:28
that's awesome uh geez i think we just
13:31
about
13:31
covered everything there on the front
13:33
and we got the terms
13:34
uh the fact that we're multi-chain now
13:38
um does armor insurance also inherit
13:40
this then like for those that do
13:42
pay-as-you-go cover
13:44
which is really to me like that's the
13:45
ultimate advantage of armor
13:47
being a distributor of nexus um do they
13:50
inherit all of this same coverage yeah
13:53
they do
13:54
so i mean armor are distributing nexus
13:56
cover so
13:57
they get the upgraded terms but i think
14:00
one of the important aspects here is
14:01
everyone that already had smart contract
14:05
cover
14:07
automatically get upgraded to the new
14:08
terms
14:10
um except for some very old policies
14:12
that
14:13
didn't require proof of loss so um those
14:16
have kind of been grandfathered but
14:17
there aren't very many of them left
14:18
either
14:18
anyway but basically um all policies get
14:22
upgraded to
14:23
um the new terms so you don't have to do
14:24
anything if you bought cover last week
14:26
and now there's a new one you don't
14:28
have to worry about that yeah yeah yeah
14:30
it's great i know you had a
14:32
like a layover period where anyone could
14:35
choose to uh
14:37
as a nexus stake or an nxm staker you
14:39
could pull out of those pools
14:41
or pull out of that cover to say
14:43
actually i don't want to cover this more
14:45
extensive version
14:47
but i think it's a huge opportunity in
14:49
terms of staking
14:50
you know i i i stake against uh
14:53
i stake using the 15x leverage so i can
14:56
you know
14:57
if i have a hundred nxm i can stake
15:00
technically i'm staking 1500 nxm
15:02
up to 100 nxm against any single
15:05
contract
15:06
which means you know at the end of the
15:08
day i think we've talked a lot before
15:10
about
15:11
this is a leverage model that helps
15:13
nexus to offer more coverage
15:16
but you know it's only because i did it
15:18
over the weekend
15:19
with how low gas was and i was like
15:22
i never had really considered how that
15:25
leverage
15:26
was benefiting me as a staker the fact
15:28
that i'm able to
15:30
you know i would describe to someone um
15:34
pretend that you can lend your stable
15:36
coins in multiple places at once
15:38
now i don't want to like i don't want to
15:40
pretend like the rates
15:41
uh that you'll earn as an nxm staker
15:45
aren't comparable to the rates of
15:47
lending like a stable coin
15:48
but nonetheless if you're willing to go
15:51
to that 15x leverage point
15:53
and and put like let's say 100 nxm
15:56
against 15 different protocols
15:58
well you're earning yield um assuming
16:00
that people buy that
16:02
that cover you're earning yield so it's
16:04
uh it's pretty cool
16:06
yeah and hopefully um our goal in the
16:08
future is to actually increase that
16:09
leverage over time as we
16:10
as we expand the neutral and cover more
16:12
risks so you know
16:14
in theory we should be able to get that
16:15
up to like maybe even 30 times in the in
16:18
the future you know that
16:19
that may seem on the surface really
16:21
crazy risky but it's actually
16:23
not that bad any when you're talking
16:26
about insurance in kind of leveraged
16:27
terms
16:27
it's not like leverage um like a
16:30
leveraged law
16:31
on a particular asset so it's it's a bit
16:34
into that yeah
16:35
yeah yeah yeah it's just uh you know
16:37
that well there's
16:38
there's two different folks that might
16:41
be interested in
16:42
all that we're talking about uh one is
16:44
the person who needs cover
16:46
so like if i if if you started
16:48
participating in ave
16:50
yield farming today with the lending and
16:52
borrowing
16:54
on either side of the market you can
16:55
earn i think it's staked ave
16:58
so if you're earning that that's great
17:00
but you're also putting your assets at
17:02
risk
17:02
and so you can buy cover for ave
17:05
actually could you just quickly show
17:07
show that hugh just maybe this is a good
17:08
way to sort of wrap up is um
17:10
let's say i want to buy cover for um
17:13
let's say i have uh 10 ether
17:17
of assets on ave how would i do that
17:20
so just select galvey um and then
17:23
we've got eighth so you've got ten
17:25
you've put 1080 in so you get
17:27
some coverage for tony and say you want
17:29
it for 30 days because
17:30
i'm not quite sure how long it's going
17:32
to last um
17:33
and then that's basically you get a
17:35
quote
17:36
tells you equate price over here accept
17:39
the terms and conditions and
17:40
go for it that's it yeah that's it it's
17:43
really how
17:44
how much how much do i want as a payout
17:46
which i would um
17:48
caution anyone uh don't put in more than
17:51
what you actually have
17:53
because that's not good you you won't
17:56
this isn't like uh
17:57
the product has changed over time it's
17:59
not meant for you to be able to
18:00
speculate and get a payout
18:02
on uh assets that don't actually need
18:05
protection
18:06
you do have to prove that you had 10
18:07
ether in there um that was
18:09
compromised yeah yeah that's right
18:12
you've got to prove your loss at playing
18:13
time that's right
18:14
that's it yeah yeah and um another thing
18:17
to consider is
18:18
uh if you do use the nexus front end
18:21
um you can do this for any other wallet
18:24
so like
18:24
i only use one wallet to buy my cover
18:27
unless i'm using armor which is awesome
18:31
pay-as-you-go
18:33
coverage but it's underwritten by nexus
18:36
which actually i guess there was one
18:38
point here that i left out so
18:41
i guess lately it was someone in the
18:43
community
18:44
uh posted a proposal to take
18:47
uh nexus to take the dow to this point
18:50
of
18:51
um no longer being what i want to say
18:54
registered in a way that like required
18:57
mutual members to kyc can you share
18:59
anything more about that and and maybe
19:01
what
19:02
what are some like updates that we might
19:04
look forward to in the
19:05
next year or so yeah cool so
19:08
um so 1kx um uh uh basically a vc in the
19:13
crypto space but also like a
19:15
early um early supporter of nexus and
19:19
um a very active member of our community
19:22
they've um
19:22
they put together a proposal um to
19:26
dissolve the legal entity that nexus
19:29
um that sits around nexus so nexus is a
19:31
dao but it also has a legal wrapper i
19:33
guess
19:34
and that that's a uk company and so
19:36
basically when you sign up to join
19:38
nexus you undergo kyc you pay a small
19:40
membership fee
19:41
and you become a member of that um that
19:44
legal company
19:45
and that gives you some protections um
19:47
and it also gives
19:48
a bunch of regulatory clarity and a
19:50
whole bunch of other kind of benefits
19:52
um but it also is not really um
19:55
in line with the decentralized ethos um
19:58
so it's kind of um
20:00
it was kind of set up in a certain way
20:02
to kind of launch the protocol in a safe
20:04
way and see where we go to
20:06
from there and so 1kx are proposing that
20:09
we dissolve the legal entity
20:11
um and therefore after that you can
20:14
remove the kyc requirement
20:16
um and and and go from there so there's
20:19
quite a few steps to
20:20
actually do that first step is get some
20:22
legal advice
20:23
then work out what we want to do and
20:24
then implement and stuff it's not
20:26
necessarily going to be a quick process
20:27
but
20:28
it's a very important discussion that i
20:30
believe all members
20:31
need to get involved in over the coming
20:33
months um because
20:34
also it's a one-way decision you can't
20:36
really go back
20:38
um and so um i think i think it's going
20:40
to be
20:41
um i think there's there's definitely
20:42
pros and cons either way i'm i'm
20:44
definitely going to be
20:45
on the fence on this one and just kind
20:47
of let the community
20:49
drive it in the decisions um so yeah
20:51
that's that's a good one to get involved
20:53
in and keep an eye on
20:55
um i guess another really big thing
20:58
that's coming up that we have been
20:59
working on for a little while is
21:01
actually enabling investment earnings on
21:03
the
21:04
asset pool um and so
21:07
basically nexus has a shared pool of
21:09
funds the liquidity
21:11
it's pretty much all held in eth right
21:13
now
21:14
and that is just basically being held um
21:17
and so
21:17
at the moment the mutual is earning its
21:20
surplus so
21:21
premium like essentially cover costs
21:23
less claims but it hasn't turned on
21:25
the second revenue stream which is what
21:27
all insurance companies
21:29
news and it's actually really big is
21:31
earning
21:32
investment returns on the float yeah um
21:35
and so this
21:36
like this can be this like
21:39
as an example us auto
21:42
most auto lines they've run at claim
21:45
ratios of 100
21:46
which means the only thing that the
21:48
insurance company is making money on is
21:49
the float is the investment earnings
21:51
um so not all product lines are unlike
21:53
that but the point being that this is
21:55
huge
21:56
um and so there's we're going to be
21:59
starting slowly and starting um to
22:01
increase it um over time
22:03
um we've and there's a there's a really
22:06
big opportunity here like if we were to
22:08
earn even like
22:09
net 45 on the float we have
22:12
as you're pulling it up now we have what
22:14
about whatever
22:16
is right now about four we have 400
22:18
million in the capital pool right
22:20
yeah yeah in terms of in terms of eth
22:22
and you know you consider like
22:24
uh this this mountain of eth has been
22:28
there
22:28
since ether was at a much lower uh
22:31
us dollar price i mean it's yeah it's
22:34
it's
22:35
nuts to think about what if this could
22:37
be earning
22:38
one two three percent i mean
22:41
anything at all and it's it's a very
22:44
large amount of money to bring in for
22:45
the mutual
22:46
which then ultimately the community the
22:48
dow can decide what to do with that
22:50
excess over time yeah exactly so default
22:54
is it just flows into the capital pool
22:56
and increases the the mcr
22:59
um and so that means the token price
23:01
goes up so you know that that would be
23:02
the default if nothing else changed
23:04
um so yeah that's it i mean this
23:08
for for me like the um the the challenge
23:12
of
23:13
uh so the bonding curve allows us to
23:16
align the interest of
23:17
mutual uh members and those who seek to
23:20
buy cover
23:21
are basically those that are like just
23:23
holding nxm or they're staking
23:26
because um you know they're helping to
23:28
provide that cover
23:29
versus those that are actually buying it
23:31
so it's it has worked
23:33
beautifully in in in many cases this is
23:36
really
23:37
one of the i think the challenges that
23:39
will be solved
23:40
uh with turning on the faucet and
23:43
allowing that ether to earn yield
23:45
because as the capital pool grows
23:47
without us going into the weeds here
23:48
because
23:49
most people aren't going to want to
23:50
discuss it but um
23:52
it means that you're now creating excess
23:55
capital and that excess capital
23:59
because of the way the nxm token works
24:02
it allows
24:03
the nxm token then to appreciate
24:06
because it it's basically the whole
24:08
point of this again is like it's
24:10
supposed to grow
24:10
if the mutual is providing cover and is
24:13
succeeding
24:14
in that mission and growing cover um and
24:16
it has
24:17
but this this capital pool like we're
24:20
we're like this close to seeing it
24:22
really like take off uh
24:24
once once once the uh the
24:27
underlying capital is able to earn more
24:29
and more yield
24:31
yeah exactly and another benefit is like
24:33
um if the underlying capital pulls
24:35
earning um returns then everyone who's
24:38
staking nxm basically effectively can
24:41
kind of add that return to
24:43
that's right taking returns as well so
24:45
um
24:46
yeah it's a it's a very important aspect
24:48
of what we're doing
24:49
we deliberately hadn't turned it on yet
24:51
for a variety of reasons do the first
24:53
things most important things first
24:55
um but but now it's getting to that time
24:58
and um
24:58
yeah it's going to be a big step and
25:00
we'll do it we'll do it gradually you
25:01
know over the next six to
25:03
12 months but you know i'm just going to
25:04
be starting soon it's funny because
25:06
every time i've interviewed you i've
25:08
said like what's next and
25:10
we we have just crossed the like a
25:14
big bridge here with protocol cover
25:16
going live this is something that we've
25:17
all been looking forward to for some
25:19
time
25:19
but uh that that last this last step of
25:23
allowing
25:24
ether to earn more
25:27
ether or if in the future i don't know
25:30
if we'll see like a pool of dye grow but
25:32
right now it's it's ether that's huge
25:34
that's that is really going to allow the
25:36
mutual to continue to grow and
25:39
to continue to offer more cover because
25:41
the one thing i left out here is just
25:44
you know in case anyone's like missed
25:46
this the annualized premiums in force
25:49
is around 20 million so just think of it
25:52
as like
25:54
if you took all the different cover
25:57
that's been bought
25:58
and you looked at that from a yearly
26:01
perspective
26:02
that this is what we're looking at in
26:04
terms of like a revenue
26:06
for nexus um the active cover is insane
26:09
at 704
26:11
million 281 000
26:14
ether um and then you can i mean
26:17
whatever you can like gloss over these
26:18
charts and
26:20
they're they're fun to look at because
26:21
it's just crazy to look at july
26:24
2020 that was an exciting time in d5 but
26:27
we only had
26:28
uh you know what is that 5.3 million
26:32
in active cover versus now take whatever
26:36
like multiple that is that that's how
26:38
much
26:38
um cover has grown um since then
26:42
yeah it's been the past year has been an
26:45
amazing journey
26:46
so yeah um it's yeah and there's a lot
26:48
more to go
26:49
we've um we can we can write one of the
26:51
things we can do that's really
26:52
interesting is we could we could
26:54
probably write about double
26:55
the amount of cover without any more
26:57
capital um
26:58
which is kind of i think that's really
27:01
important because i think um
27:03
especially with uni swap v3 coming out
27:05
soon
27:06
i think there's going to be more of a
27:07
focus on capital efficiency
27:09
um being being a thing in d5 um rather
27:12
than just
27:13
tvl so um that's that's going to be an
27:16
interesting aspect as well
27:17
and we've always focused on the capital
27:18
efficiency side of things from the start
27:20
yeah um i've got just one question
27:22
someone was asking
27:23
will the nxm staking requirement always
27:26
be 20 or will it eventually be lowered
27:29
um if anyone's wondering like if you go
27:31
into nexus to
27:32
stake nxm to offer cover um
27:36
it's a minimum of 20 nxm to deposit
27:39
yeah so our goal is to remove that um
27:42
what we're trying to
27:43
it basically causes quite a lot of gas
27:45
costs to actually process the rewards
27:47
um and we're looking to revisit how the
27:50
staking rewards
27:51
mechanically work and once we've done
27:52
that the idea is to remove those types
27:54
of limits so it becomes
27:56
essentially up to the user if they want
27:58
to um do it at lower
28:00
amounts if they wish yeah yeah yeah good
28:02
stuff well
28:03
um hugh i i think we covered everything
28:05
then so i'm just gonna
28:07
thank anyone for tuning in this was uh
28:10
like i said first of
28:11
hopefully many uh uh
28:15
so what did i call it here d5 talks with
28:17
deep ident i don't even
28:19
clearly i've thought a lot about this
28:20
and uh yeah no please join us in the
28:23
future
28:23
um we'll continue to host interviews
28:25
through yield tv
28:26
and um and other channels but hopefully
28:29
this
28:30
is a another place where you can enjoy
28:32
uh learning more about d5 with
28:34
you know uh some of the the biggest
28:36
founders in d5 like you
28:38
so um hugh i'll let you say bye
28:40
