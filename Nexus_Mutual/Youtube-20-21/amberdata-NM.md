welcome to the Amber data podcast where we explore everything from technology finance and blockchain today I'm joined
0:14
by Hugh karp the founder of Nexus mutual and onchain insurance protocol Hugh welcome to the podcast thanks so much
0:19
for joining us cool not a problem thanks really um thanks a lot for having me on yeah absolutely so Hugh before we jump
0:27
into like the meat and potatoes of Nexus I'd love to just kind of get a background on on yourself like what what
0:34
got you into this space what got you to build in this space and and why and Nexus has been around you guys launched
0:40
in 2018 2019 yeah 2019 we've been around for a little while now yeah yeah so you guys have have kind of seen the space
0:46
develop so I'd love to kind of go your journey into the space into building a
0:51
protocol in the space and kind of How It's developed further and then you know then we can obviously jump into
0:56
everything that you guys are doing right now and Space is really interesting so yeah I'd love to learn about how did you get into this
1:02
space yeah I guess um like personally my background is um traditional insurance
1:08
I'm a life insurance act by by trade so um spent like 10 years in Australia
1:13
doing um working for General traditional life insurance companies and moved moved to the UK and worked for mune for um a
1:20
fair few years and was the CFO there for their life business um for a little while um and so I guess I got I got a
1:25
lot of background in the insurance the insurance side of things um and I guess on on the personal side of stuff I got I
1:32
got in I did get involved in um like played around with Bitcoin relatively early on I I found it really fascinating
1:38
and um I thought it was really kind of amazing that you could send some money to someone else on the other side of the
1:44
internet no no one knew um like where it was coming from whatever there was no one in the middle and I thought yeah I
1:49
thought it was really fascinating but I didn't really I didn't really know what to to do with it so after playing with it for a bit I kind of left it alone um
1:56
but then I guess 2016 or so like about a year after ethereum was launched I kind
2:02
of got in back into things um I guess that's when it really clicked from from my perspective because I kind of figured
2:09
if you could if you could you know write smaller programs which we now call SM smart contracts on a on a blockchain
2:14
then you could kind of re like an insurance contract is kind of if something happens then do something so
2:19
it kind of really fits really well with that um and and also I guess I've always
2:25
kind of liked the the mutual structure of of insurance where it's owned by the
2:31
the policy holders it's like owned by the members and stuff so self it's self owned or Community owned um and I
2:37
thought that was like really that's the really natural kind of insurance structure that's been around for like
2:42
Millennia even like it's it's nothing new it's something very very old um and like I kind of put those two things
2:48
together um and decided to kind of build build Nexus so I guess it was a it was an interest in the tech for then I guess
2:55
my background insurance and kind of pulling it all together that's very cool and I think one thing that's that's really interesting where crypto enables
3:02
like the blockchain enables a lot of the stuff is the mutual perspective is is kind of like the the shared
3:08
responsibility of a lot of these things so if you look at every you know every major dii protocol it's just Collective
3:14
liquidity providing utility across to you know whoever wants to use it and I think that's a very core like principle
3:22
that that blockchain crypto and specifically kind of the ethereum ecosystem was able to unlock with all
3:28
this stuff so that's really cool and I think I think as as the space grows that models just kind of remained consistent
3:36
you don't really see a lot of deviation from it um but it is really cool to see that like that early on the
3:42
mutual approach was something you kind of saw as as the formula to
3:48
apply you know for yeah I think yeah I mean I think it's really I think it's really fascinating like I really like
3:53
the mutual approach from an insurance perspective because I think it aligns interests a bit better and things um but
3:59
there specific reasons why the mutual approach like like it's it's I guess
4:05
it's do insurance world is dominated by the shareholder companies it's not dominated by the mutual companies and there's a good reasons for that um I
4:11
guess one of the big ones is access to Capital um like sh youve got a shareholder company you can inject
4:17
shareholder Capital Etc um but one of the really interesting things about blockchain is you can tokenize the
4:23
membership rights or whatever and you can effectively get a lot of capital flexibility into the mutual model that
4:30
you couldn't really do before so I think a lot and there's a few other reasons that um that mutuals that shareholder
4:37
companies are tend to be better than Mutual companies but um but I think the the tech I think that's one example of
4:43
what where we've got new tech that can do new things that we can really kind of reinvigorate these old structures and I
4:48
guess that's like we're not trying to like reinvent like we're doing new something
4:54
very old with new technology so there's a whole lot of principles and stuff that have existed and exist ases especially
5:00
in the insurance World about aligning interests looking at the longterm and everything like that and to me it was
5:05
about using this new tech to reinvigorate those kind of principles and and use them yeah so as you entered
5:13
kind of you were you were dabbling around with Bitcoin got excited by ethereum when was kind of the the moment
5:20
and you have the background to build this stuff when was kind of the moment where we were like okay now is the time
5:26
to start focusing on on Nexus yeah I think I have a look back on
5:32
reflection we probably did it a bit early but um but you know I was um I was definitely Keen to get it started and um
5:39
you know things were changing at at work and it seemed like a bit of a shifting point for me and so there was just a
5:45
personally a spot where it just made sense to kind of jump off give it a shot let's see if we can get something
5:51
happening here um and so that kind of happened in like um 2018 we raised the seed around and started developing the
5:58
protocol Etc um and then in like May 2019 we eventually got to to main it um
6:05
like prior to Def summer and everything so actually one of the first defi protocols on on on Main before defy was
6:10
actually a term that people were using um so yeah it was um it was really it
6:16
was really cool to kind of be there the early days and see how things have developed and how they've shifted over time because there's obviously just been
6:22
massive growth in the sector yeah and I imagine you've like I mean being in in
6:27
the ethereum ecosystem early like you've seen kind of the hack landscape develop
6:32
so like you've kind of seen I imagine you were there or involved or paying attention during you know the Dow hack
6:39
and then you have kind of every new new exploit kind of coming online and then
6:45
being adjusted for it through every new you know EIP that kind of helps mitigate a lot of these things um so so as you
6:54
began to build Nexus you know obviously like you guys have a a lot of interesting products
7:01
that you kind of like cover can you kind of talk about the the evolution of the
7:06
products that you guys offer from when you started to what you're seeing now because obviously the products you offer
7:11
are dependent on the landscape and how it's evolved as well so can you maybe like walk through where it was to where
7:18
you are now and discuss kind of the products that that users can get coverage on yeah I think the bit of the aha
7:25
moment for for us early on was when we saw like I saw the Dow hack live like I
7:30
watched the I was watching the block explorers with the money coming out and I was like oh my God this is crazy um
7:36
and then I and I kind of like was I was thinking about Nexus and how to build it and that was kind of one of the AHA moments of well hold on if we if we're
7:43
going to be successful in this space and people are going to actually allocate funds they're going to need some protection against this risks because
7:49
they just um we just can't handle that type of um I guess downside or um you
7:54
know this the money all just disappearing somewhere um and so that was kind of where we started from um and
8:00
so we really started with that um smart contract cover type um risk where if there was a hack basically the smart
8:07
contract didn't do what it was intended to do people just drained the money out of it that's what um that's what we
8:13
would cover and to be honest that's been the core a lot of what we've done we've um we've updated the product we've um
8:19
you know fixed some holes added it on some other um you know different instiller benefits and stuff like that
8:25
but I mean at the core the product is pretty much um very similar and and that's actually driving a lot um of our
8:31
growth um right now um I guess one of the bigger changes over the past several
8:39
um months and year is has been like the bundling of the product so a lot of the
8:44
time because you've got this composability within defi you have protocol a on top of B on top of c and
8:51
there's this element of like stacked risk and so you're exposing yourself to a whole range of Smart contracts rather
8:58
than just one um and and so we've developed products specifically to cover the stack risk of specific positions um
9:06
Etc and so like most of our users at the moment um and are basically deploying
9:11
into defy they're earning yield um a lot of it's ebased yield at the moment um
9:17
and they they're getting you know somewhere from 20 30 40 50% um apy and
9:22
obviously that comes with its own degrees of risk but we tend to cover the the Smite contract risk on that so they
9:29
can they can deploy and get a relatively high yield take off the cost of coverage and still be in a pretty good position
9:35
but from a yield perspective but be much more comfortable from a risk perspective on the you know the likelihood of the
9:41
full principal loss is extremely reduced so that's kind of um that's kind of the main use uses we've got at the moment
9:48
and um we I guess just more in terms of like who uses our platform it does it's
9:54
kind of a bit that 8020 rule but um like 80% of the volume is kind of driven by
9:59
20% of the the clients but um a bigger clients tend to be like funds or um like
10:06
professional players deploying into this space um and so and so they and then we often work with them um you know on
10:14
messaging on telegram all the time to make sure they got the right capacity in the right places to get the coverage that they need so um yeah so I think
10:21
it's it's working really well on that side of things um a couple of the other products that we do offer we offer some
10:27
we offer slashing risk on like staking networks and um also some other staking networks um but we also buildt a
10:34
protocol that's quite flexible and can cover any type of thing and like one thing I'd like to throw out there is
10:39
we're actually covering some um some shop owners in the UK um from like fire
10:44
and flood and um theft type risk as well so um which is I think is really cool
10:50
because we're just actually using the onchain world to cover um the the real world in a few places and stuff so we we
10:56
main we definitely mainly do the crypto stuff but we are doing some some other interesting things on the side as well
11:02
that's really interesting because I think as just as the general space has matured and evolved like you've seen a
11:08
lot of I remember in the early days there was kind of this we'll tokenize everything mentality it was like real
11:15
estate and titles and deeds and all this stuff's going to be moved on chain and you realize like there's a lot of like
11:21
regulatory red tape that that doesn't let you just like do that instantly but we're kind of at this like inflection
11:27
point I feel where things real World assets are coming onchain and vice versa
11:32
like the onchain world is being used to kind of uh unlock liquidity in in kind
11:38
of the real world quote unquote real world I think this is all real but kind of the onchain and offchain
11:45
components are are starting to mingle a lot more which is really cool to see that you guys are are have have exposure
11:52
or products that offer you know coverage from that perspective so one of the things from like the product perspective
11:58
that I'm curious about is you know obviously you guys operating in a a
12:04
decentralized protocol nature is is how do you determine the protocol coverage
12:09
like how do you determine we're going to for example igen I mean you guys have a lot of coverage on igen layer and bundled Igan layer for like you know
12:16
your layered risk um that you're seeing in the market and I think that's a that is a real risk and we've kind of seen
12:22
crypto it's layered risk happened before um like how you know let's say I lach a
12:29
protocol tomorrow how how how is it decided whether you guys would support that is it something that you know the
12:36
the token holders would would kind of work through is it kind of like a delegated process or or maybe a combo I don't yeah
12:45
it's a bit of a combination the the first um the first thing is like there's a decision whether we list the protocol
12:51
um or not um that's kind of the step one and that's basically just um us and our
12:57
community working with the the protocol teams um so that's kind of step one but that doesn't actually open up any
13:03
capacity um step two is that we actually have to have our stakers and they're the ones with the money on the line um they
13:09
are the ones that have to allocate stake um so they they stake in our native token um and they they stake against
13:16
specific risks um so they would stake against this particular protocol and then they would they would set the price
13:21
as well so you can and we have multiple saking pools and the ROM is behind the scenes um and so um so essentially it's
13:30
bit of a conversation between them and ask like is it worth listing this or not are you going to back it because it's
13:35
bit pointless listing it if they're not going to stake against it um so we have a bit of a conversation then we list it on the protocol and then theyum and then
13:42
they come and stake against it so um and you know they'll stake more and at lower prices the more confident they are on
13:48
the risk and then we have and then the protocol has some also some controls that are a total level to make sure that
13:54
we're not Overexposed to any one particular protocol Etc um and so it's a
13:59
combination of those types of um things but in reality it's really Nexus is
14:06
really like a Marketplace for risk and um and we're trying to facilitate the
14:11
the EAS like the fastest way to transfer risk between um the people that want the cover and the the people are willing to
14:16
back it so yeah yeah that makes a lot of sense and so from from kind of somebody
14:22
who's been been more or less working in kind of the the risk of what's going on
14:27
on Shain like what are some of the things that you've learned just like either anecdotally or firsthand running
14:33
a protocol that that is helping kind of mitigate risk like what are some of the not just not just being you know what
14:39
are some of like the the primary vulnerabilities or like safest routes to like even operate onchain because I think that's even a more new
14:46
understanding the protocol risk is obviously really important and the Stacked protocol risk but what are some things that you think are like maybe red
14:54
flags are just things to to you know appropriately pay attention to like I think I think maybe protocols with
15:00
massive TV tvls or kind of like a Honeypot contract which is likely to be
15:06
a good reason to take out you know coverage on something like that but are there other things like that that you guys tend to say like know yeah there's
15:14
definitely some key things we obviously look at um one like obviously audits um
15:20
and the quality who's done the audit what are the audit results um like if you actually know what you're looking
15:26
for in audits you can like the Auditors aren't going to say this these guys are terrible but you can read between the
15:32
lines and work out which ones are and which ones aren't um and and so there's
15:37
there's definitely that that's kind of step one and also you can which order
15:43
companies they've engaged in as well it's a big is a big difference um the I
15:48
guess there's an um one of the other points that that maybe not be obvious is um people when when a teams Fork
15:55
protocols they go oh we inherit the security but they they don't actually um because as soon as you've fed a
16:01
protocol if you fed a protocol you're not the original owner so you don't know all those little quirks on the edges and
16:06
then you might make an an adjustment because it's slightly different and you do it wrong and um and then that's when
16:12
the B can slip in um but also um also a lot of the protocol security is not just
16:19
actually the code that's been released it's actually the response about if something does happen if there's a bug
16:25
disclosure or if there's something like how do you actually handle that um like I get us a good example over the recent
16:31
years is balancer balancer has had some pretty serious bugs that have been disclosed um over the time but they've
16:38
done an extraordinary job of minimizing the um the impact by um a variety of
16:44
techniques but um but basically led to minimal if any losses um and so you know
16:49
I think um they they handled that really well but anyone who would for balcer may not have may not go through that process
16:55
as well so so I think that there's a it's kind of weird operating in this you know code is the thing right is the
17:02
drives everything but but also there's there's still a lot of the people behind it from it the matter from a security
17:09
perspective because um I guess if everything's running normally then you
17:14
just that's the code that's what it does right um but it's when things don't go normally that you kind of fall back to the human element and um and it's those
17:22
humans and how they interact in their skill sets and um you know and what they
17:27
want to get out of it like if if you're walking a protocol and just um trying to quickly pump a token and all the rest of
17:33
it you're going to be much less focused on security than than someone who's there for build a protocol for a really
17:38
long term and stuff so yeah there's there's those types of things that that come into it and um I think our risk
17:44
assessors and a stakers um they they've been around and seen a lot of this stuff and it's um quite easy to categorize one
17:51
way or another um pretty quickly just by looking at things but but I guess the other thing is like we're also on the
17:57
front edge on the kind of Frontier of risk here and we like we our job is to
18:03
help more people allocate and get involved um and so you know we want to
18:08
cover as much as possible as as well so it's it's definitely a balance between um making sure that we cover risks that
18:16
are that are good but but and also like covering as much as we can to get people
18:22
that's really interesting I think like obviously a lot of people who see kind of the exploits and
18:30
risk assign technical issue to it and not so much like the human component of
18:36
like when things go wrong how quickly are they addressed how fast can they patch these things how quickly does the community rally around a protocol and I
18:43
think those are some of the other like the interesting components is like the the the shared nature of a protocol
18:50
allows like the community to kind of like Drive the the fix or even like the
18:56
innovation of a protocol you can for obviously you can Fork any protocol almost I mean theoretically and but that
19:03
doesn't mean you're going to capture the same audience and so there's that's a really interesting way to kind of look
19:08
at the way that that you assign risk outside of just like the Audits and the technical piece but like the responsiveness and the human element
19:15
because you're right at the end of the day like humans are pushing the deploy button to fix these things you know this
19:20
isn't like a fully automated autonomous ecosystem as much as you know it aspires
19:26
to be there's still still that piece so on kind of like the the the risk side
19:32
now like assume that like a user has coverage on a
19:37
protocol and and they they experience an exploit and they're they're going through the claims process right so like
19:45
in my mind if I had like a shared Mutual I wouldn't want I wouldn't want to minimize my my payouts but like what's
19:53
the how do you determine the validity of a claim because like I I noticed a lot
19:58
of them like we don't you know it's not uh like deep pegging risk we kind of we don't cover or maybe it's product by
20:04
product but um or like rug pul obviously is like a very common one but it's like unintended use of the code is generally
20:11
like the the primary focus of this so like what's the determining factor and
20:16
how does that process go through um once you know once an exploit
20:21
happens yeah I mean essentially it's a it's a human process because you have to
20:27
basically at that point the code broken you can't rely on the code anymore so we can't do a formula approach right so you
20:33
kind of you are into the world of humans but um but the way it works is we have an incentive mechanism where anyone can
20:39
St and any token to vote on claims and they must lock that up for a longer period of time um and there's a there's
20:45
a threat of um that stake being burned if they clearly vote maliciously like if
20:51
they deliberately approve a claim that's clearly not a claim or vice versa um and
20:58
so yeah because you need that so that the system can't be attacked but but in general um the everything within Nexus
21:05
is all about align incentives over the long term and so um and the claims
21:11
assessment process is like critical in this because if we don't pay claims and the mutual m might as well not exist
21:17
right um and and so everything is a design for the long term because if you if you're just looking at one claim and
21:22
you're just looking at the at the short term then you shouldn't approve any claim because it doesn't make any sense right um but if but if you want to play
21:28
repetitive game and over a longer term then there's there's value by approving the um the the genuine claims um and so
21:36
there's essentially a voting mechanism with a staking on top of it um and what that's effectively become is a a smaller
21:43
group of like five to 10 people within the mutual that have kind of self selected claims experts and they're the
21:49
ones that generally vote on these things um I mean with with most of the protocol hacks it's pretty clear one way or
21:55
another what's if if it's within it or not um and from a user point of view all
22:00
you have to do is like prove that you had a you controlled an account that was impacted um and then so you just sign a
22:08
message from an account that was obviously um that was impacted and then and then you um basically get um will'll
22:13
get the claim payment once it's approved through the process um I guess you know
22:18
the only thing we can really say there is like we can point to our track record now and we've paid like 18 million of
22:24
claims over I can't remember how many events but it's probably something like 10 10 to 12 events um and so we've paid
22:31
out on um a whole bunch of smart contract hacks Oiler being probably the biggest um one um but like from year bzx
22:40
way back when um and there's been there's been a whole a cream there's been a whole bunch of them but we've
22:45
also also paid out on things like um FDX and Celsius when we offered um custody coverage um for those products as well
22:51
so um so yeah we paid about four and a half million on FTX um at the time um so
22:58
yeah like um you know 18 million is not a it's a small small number so you know
23:03
we' we have we are definitely you know it takes a long time to prove these things but um but I think we're on the
23:09
right track and we can obviously need more history and stuff to increase confidence but um but I think we're
23:15
definitely on the right track yeah absolutely and one I mean one of the things that's really interesting from uh
23:20
from a data perspective is like I mean you can say you paid out your track record and we can see you've paid out
23:26
like we can see and quantify your track record we can see and quantify the you know the coverage that your users have
23:33
taken out and we can so like you you have like a risk assessment strategy but
23:38
also like the community has this like layered like ability to Monitor and
23:43
maintain like their uh their view into what Nexus is doing and like it's really
23:49
it's really interesting from that perspective is like you have this like automated you know risk view into the
23:57
protocol itself so if you you have questions on how are are token holders voting on uh claims how are they staking
24:04
their assets like how's coverage shifting from protocol to protocol like you can really see this stuff and I
24:09
think that's like from a user perspective is really interesting like if I were if I were operating on chain
24:15
without any any knowledge I mean tbll is a really good metric to see things that are interesting and people are using but
24:21
on the inverse like I want to see where they see that risk as well you know and so where they're exposing looking for
24:28
coverage is is kind of them ascribing where they see potential risk
24:34
at the same time and so I think that's another like really interesting view that I I don't know maybe maybe from
24:40
your time in like the the traditional Insurance world I don't know how that differs from from what you guys are
24:46
seeing but I'd be curious like the trans yeah I think that's a really
24:53
interesting point like um yeah I was I was in was a safe role in the traditional compan so you had the you
24:59
know cly yearly reporting Cycles to go get through and everything and um and when I came down to it you had like it
25:07
took you three months to get the view of where you were like three months ago and
25:12
here we just have real- time data on absolutely everything it's such a massive shift when I when I show people
25:18
from my like old colleagues or people from traditional industry like oh yeah um how's your finances doing on how's
25:25
the mutual going okay you can see everything here you go here's every single policy here's every single um claim we've paid or denied you can see
25:32
you can you can come to your own view on if that was the right thing or not here's the amount of capital we got these are the assets it's invested in
25:38
it's like um here's the Surplus we made yesterday um you know it's kind of um
25:43
it's such a dramatic shift from where things are at the moment in the traditional industry that um I mean and
25:50
I know people like you know Gary gendler and others say oh there's not enough reporting and all the rest of it I mean
25:56
honestly if you get into it that's just like it's completely rubbish like there's there is unbelievable reporting
26:03
available like yes you may have to need some um skills to actually extract the
26:08
data from the blockchain to put it in a presentable way but the information is there and like in our teams and a
26:13
community have built some really solid dashboards to kind of show that um stuff and and I think just in in general being
26:20
able to put that information in front of people um especially from nexus's point of view when people go oh how much
26:27
Capital do you actually have and what's your history on paying claims and I can just go there it is you can see in real time like it just it just gives so much
26:34
confidence um you know we are doing something new but um and you know take
26:39
confidence takes time to build but that's a big part of it um and and I think um I think if you think back even
26:46
more broadly um one of the one of the things that I really like about what we're doing is if you think about the
26:52
key principles of why you actually regulate a bank or regulate an insurance company um it's it's basically be for
26:59
two reasons one is there's you're effectively giving control over to
27:05
someone else so there's this agency at risk you're relying on the management of the bank or insurance company and
27:10
secondly there's a massive asymmetry of information between the policy holder and and the people running it on the
27:16
inside and so and I think the tech that we've got can just massively change the game on both of those fronts um and I
27:23
think we can do and I think fundamentally it's just a better model better approach um and so and I think
27:30
the you know data transparency and availability um real ESS of of it all is
27:36
is such a massive step forward that you know it's it's kind of taken for granted when you're in the space a bit for a
27:42
while but as soon as you start talking to people outside it again it's um it you do kind of realize oh yes it is
27:49
really important and it does make a big difference yeah absolutely and I think um like to that point I think like the
27:55
transparency really like does drive like the long-term Trust of the protocol too
28:01
like there's a reason like all all the tooling and insights on this stuff is like accelerated massively past you know
28:09
traditional you know company reporting quarterly like this stuff is real time now it's as instant as you want it to be
28:15
and to your point it does does take work to get that stuff out but it's there and you know you you can pull it out if you
28:22
need it so one of the things uh on the transparency side we were at Amber data
28:28
we were working on some uh research around liquid staking tokens more specifically outside of just the native
28:33
yield but there's this Capital efficiency component so I don't have to lock up my eth I I can lock up my eth
28:41
earn yield and continue to use my eth and so we were we were kind of studying what what people are doing with liquid
28:49
staking tokens kind of across the defi ecosystem and one of the things that we we noticed as we were kind of analyzing
28:54
smart contracts that were holding large balances of liquid state tokens was your
29:00
Capital pool contract has a pretty significant balance of of um stake de
29:05
and I think some rocket pool eat as well um from a a D5 protocol that's been in
29:12
the space you know for a long time can you maybe talk about like treasury management Capital pool efficiency like
29:18
what are you guys doing with that and I think like where's how do you see that trending across kind of the ecosystem as
29:24
well yeah so I think a lot of a lot of this comes back to how like an insurance
29:29
company should manage what they call their Floats or their assets their Capital pool um and in in the
29:36
traditional um traditional Insurance you basically invest in lowrisk um reliable
29:42
yielding assets and so you know you're talking about government bonds or treasuries or whatever right um and and
29:48
often long dat stuff because yeah you want to hold this stuff for the very long term um and so nexus's Capital PLL
29:55
is predominantly denominated in e um and so the very natural asset is State the
30:02
state version of that um and you know we we choose the the ones we've chosen at the moment and we're then allocating
30:08
looking to allocate to a few more over over time um are going to be the ones with higher liquidity so that um if we
30:14
do need to exit we can reliably exit um but I think it's it's quite um it's
30:20
critical for us that manage that quite conservatively because like the primary purpose of that float is to back the um
30:27
the potential CL and so you don't you don't want to put that at risk and you don't want to kind of you also don't really want to double down on stuff that
30:34
you're covering because you could lose both on the outset and the liability side then you could be a problem um and
30:39
so you know you have to take all those types of things into account and so we do um invest it rather conservatively
30:45
but um but I do think that um eth and stake e is a very kind of um I don't
30:52
know if if e kind of the capital product of the internet and it's kind of can consider that kind of like own country
30:58
in some ways then it's very analogous to the the Government Bond um in the traditional space so um you know I think
31:06
um that's kind of how how why we're allocating there and stuff and so you know because we've got a significant
31:11
pool of e that that um that makes a a decent return for our members as well
31:17
yeah and that's really interesting because I think you look at a lot of the activity on chain of you know these assets being used in kind of you know
31:24
lending protocols amm and kind of the Dex land space but then I think when it comes to like Capital efficiency
31:30
treasury management and things like that that's kind of like the next wave especially for like the the defi like
31:36
native protocols like that is your risk risk-free rate but like you know that's
31:42
that really is your your internet Bond and I think seeing protocols use that
31:48
obviously makes a lot of sense and I I would imagine that you'd expect folks and protocols and you know massive
31:55
treasuries to continue to do that moving forward and it's and it's interesting because like you mentioned the other
32:00
half of the insurance business is kind of the float side well the float side didn't really exist when you guys
32:06
started like it was I mean the lowrisk option there wasn't really a lowrisk option before
32:13
then right so the long to to your point of like playing the long-term game ethereum has always had that vision of
32:20
of uh group of stake right so you're relying on the the protocol Engineers to
32:27
kind of move this space forward at the same time like that's unlocked so much more opportunity for your protocol to
32:33
kind of like expand into kind of the other half of of what the insurance business is which is really interesting
32:39
to just kind of see how to your point like if you're if you're paying attention to the long-term vision of this stuff not shortterm speculating on
32:47
you know pump a token so you know moons but more so from the standpoint of like where's the protocol natively building
32:54
how can we move alongside that and then when these these kind kind of upgrades occur how can how can that enable
33:01
different parts of our business and I think that's really cool to see you guys kind of taking like the long-term View
33:07
and then as these upgrades come through obviously like it's reflective on on chain you can see all this stuff
33:12
happening yeah yeah exactly it's interesting we wrote the P wrote the white paper in
33:18
2017 and it and it basically said oh we're going to get E denominated capital pool and then once once staking gets
33:25
enabled in a year or two or whatever thought it was going to at that point um we'll start earning some staking yield
33:31
took a bit longer than that but we did get there and we are there now so it's good to see absolutely so uh before we
33:39
kind of wrap up I'd love to kind of know what's the the next iteration for you guys like what's on the road map what
33:45
are some of the things that you're excited by in this space and like what are what are you guys looking to to do
33:51
in the short to long term yeah I I think we're definitely Focus very heavily on
33:56
the on the onchain or crypto risk stuff we just think there's so much opportunity to expand that and protect
34:01
more people coming on chain um one thing that's very interesting that we're looking to build out now is um we've
34:08
kind of started as a um like a full stack um coverage provider not not
34:14
insurance company but coverage provider um and and so you know you come to Nexus societ and you go and go through the
34:20
entire process of you know buying a cover or staking and you can do the whole thing um but we're but we're moving to this um model where
34:28
where other people are building on top of Nexus they're building like staking pools on top of Nexus they're creating
34:33
their own front ends for people to buy cover for specific risks they're Distributing coverage in a different way
34:39
um Etc um and so we've got like some projects building on layer twos that are kind of tapped into our system on Main
34:45
net um and and so there's there's definitely different things there so they're they're building more embedded coverage more like bundled coverage like
34:53
more point of sale Integrations and stuff like that so um so that that's very but but also if you actually become
35:00
a staking pool manager and you've got a new product that idea or something that you want to sell to someone else then
35:06
you can also develop it and like develop the product yourself um and and we can
35:11
help you get it listed on Nexus and stuff so we're actually kind of turning Nexus more into a protocol it's more
35:17
about a Marketplace for risk um and and so so we've started with this full stack
35:22
but then we're looking to really grow the ecosystem a lot more broadly so um obviously still focusing on the crypto
35:28
stuff um for now but um but I think there's there's definitely a lot of potential in that it requires um experts
35:35
that they know what they're doing um but we've we've got some good teams building on top of us now that um that are
35:41
starting to show some good growth at the moment so it's good to see yeah that's really exciting and I do think like that
35:47
that's one of the key like unlocks that that crypto's allowed people to do is is
35:53
this kind of almost s it's like the Unis swap model of like I I can get an asset
35:59
listed you know without any permission and and so if you can kind of build these these products on top of the
36:04
protocol then it's for the market to your point the marketplace is going to determine where they're going to
36:10
allocate so that's really interesting that's exciting um well Hugh I don't want to take too much of your time but
36:17
outside of the Nexus side of the world and being crypto nerds and probably living in this space and breathing this
36:22
stuff like what are some of the other things in the ecosystem that you're just paying attention to high level or some
36:27
of the areas that are just exciting or fun to explore in in the would say the free time that that you have but I know
36:34
there's much of it yeah I guess I I I guess I I there's so much now I used to
36:40
be able to keep on top of basically everything and that was that was definitely a while ago I can't haven't been able to do that for several years
36:46
um but um I guess since D5 summer it's kind of just got kind of crazy but um
36:52
but I think I'm more focused on the um on the D side of things just basically
36:57
that's where we operate um so you know I don't ask me about meme coins or whatever I have no idea or nfts I don't
37:03
really know what's going on um but um but I guess more interested in in the defi stuff and I think one thing that
37:10
I've kind of feeling at the moment is like I feel like the core protocols the the core functionality or
37:17
the big protocols so the big things you want to do like borrow or swap or whatever like I feel like most of that
37:23
stuff's been developed I mean I'm sure you can all you know create tweaks and create new protocol and all the rest of
37:28
it but it feels like the the bigger unlock from here is more going to be about newer experience and bundling
37:36
those into a nice um thing for um either end users if they're retail into a nice
37:42
app or something like that um that type of thing I feel like the more of the growth and more of the stuff that's interesting right now is more on that um
37:49
interaction side or uux side of things um because I I I kind of feel like the core stuff's being being built from an
37:57
structure protocol point of view if you want to describe it that way um and so
38:03
um I'm looking forward those are the types of things I'm kind of interested in and seeing and seeing where they go
38:08
yeah and I think that's so true I think being in the space you kind of take for granted a lot of the things that are inconvenient that you deal with and
38:15
they're just normal part of of your workflow but if you were to explain if
38:20
you try to onboard anybody it's kind of anybody normal who doesn't really you know exist in this space uh it it's it's
38:28
pretty challenging I would agree with you it's exciting to see it it's moving forward that way I do think that there's a long way to go yeah well Hugh I
38:37
appreciate you taking the time where can folks follow you uh Nexus where can they
38:42
check this out and any anything you want to plug for them to check out be great yeah just just I guess follow us on X um
38:50
hop or Nexus Mutual that's probably the the um easiest jumping in point and um
38:55
and then or you can go to Nexus Mutual .io and um yeah and find us from there
39:01
you can our app or join our I guess join our Discord um from there if you want to
39:06
chat about things next us um but yeah I guess we're kind of all over the place but um there's always someone there to
39:12
um to help you out if you've got any questions or stuff and I guess we're always happy to answer questions on risk and that type of thing because that's
39:18
where we've got um a decent chunk of expertise so um yeah um check us out now
39:25
one of our community members Brave New D5 releases a state of the yields um
39:30
report every he's trying to do it every week I think he's doing it every two weeks but we'll see how it goes um but
39:35
that's that's um that's really good to to follow if you're looking at def5 and where the yields might be so um that's
39:41
probably the thing to plug if okay we'll add that we'll add the uh the link to
39:47
it's a newsletter yeah yeah yeah yeah I'll give you the link after we can can get from
39:52
the beautiful well hu thank you so much for joining we really appreciate you taking the time cool no thank you for
39:58
having us on it's um yeah really good to chat thank you absolutely [Music]
