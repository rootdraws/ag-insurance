260. NMPIP: Redirect RAMM Value to Stakers to Increase NXM Staking and TVL
Since its inception, Nexus Mutual has firmly established itself as the original, leading decentralized insurance alternative protocol serving the crypto-native community. As we look toward the future, it’s essential to reflect on the foundation we’ve built, the impact we've had, and the bold steps ahead to scale and evolve.

On behalf of the Nexus Mutual teams, Hugh Karp is proposing that members grant the Advisory Board the authority to upgrade the protocol to redirect the value accrued through the RAMM, potentially with some additional NXM minted, to NXM stakers directly to attract additional underwriting capital and staked NXM.

The precise NXM being allocated will be delegated to future snapshot votes. This vote is to gain agreement on the general approach and enable the Nexus Mutual Team to begin development work required.

Rationale
A Proven Track Record in Crypto-Native Risk Protection
Nexus Mutual was created to provide meaningful protection against risks inherent in decentralized systems. Over the years, we've successfully delivered cover against smart contract vulnerabilities, slashing events, depeg scenarios, and custodial failures. Our track record and transparent claims process have made us the go-to insurance alternative for top-tier participants in the space.

Trusted by DeFi's Elite

Nexus Mutual has built deep trust within the industry. Some of the most respected and well-capitalized DeFi allocators rely on Nexus Mutual to protect their portfolios. Their ongoing support is a testament to our resilience, reputation, and the value proposition of a fully onchain mutual. This established trust places Nexus Mutual in a very advantageous strategic position, as the next wave of capital into DeFi is not only going to be much larger but it will be more risk averse. New entrants will be looking for assurances across all aspects of investing and coverage will be a key part of that. If we execute well, this will have a multiplier effect as larger waves of risk averse capital seek coverage.

Capital Flows and the RAMM

The launch of the [Ratcheting Automated Market Maker (RAMM)](https://docs.nexusmutual.io/protocol/nxm-token/token-model) in November 2023 marked a major step forward. In just a short period, [the RAMM has accrued over 5,620 ETH (approx. $24M) in value to long-term aligned members](https://dune.com/queries/4489888/7505525). This aligns incentives, rewards quality risk assessment and opens new possibilities for scaling capital provision. However, while the RAMM has coordinated orderly capital outflows while increasing value for members it has not yet stimulated any material capital inflows for the Mutual. Capital growth is also going to be required for the next phase and we must consider the best ways to attract capital to the Mutual.

Proposed Next Steps for the Protocol (Specification)
To maintain momentum and amplify our impact, Hugh is proposing the following key next steps on behalf of the Nexus Mutual teams:

Redirect RAMM Value to Stakers to Increase NXM Staking and TVL

The RAMM has been very successful since its inception in November 2023. It has allowed orderly capital exits and through its buyback mechanism has added material value to those members than remain in the Mutual.

This value-add has been spread among all NXM holders. As is the case with other buyback programs in DeFi, it hasn’t really received the recognition it deserves. Somewhat related, the Mutual would benefit from having more of the NXM supply staked and fully backing risk. The staked NXM is what really adds value to the Mutual.

I’m proposing that we redirect the value accrued through the RAMM, potentially with some additional NXM minted, to NXM stakers directly. This would be a similar model to Ethena and EtherFi where the rewards are allocated to a smaller proportion of the token holders that are more active.

At current staking levels this would increase NXM staking yields by 20-24%, for a total ranging from 25-40% (staking yields by pool vary quite a lot).

This would not only materially change the number of NXM staked, but also attract more capital to the pool as these yields are ~90% ETH denominated and even though they contain material risk due to claims slashing 30%+ yields on ETH are very hard to come by.

* At current RAMM value add, this corresponds to roughly 108,000 NXM per year (before adding any additional NXM)

* Spread over the existing NXM staked of 452,000 this is a boost of 23.9%

* If the goal of doubling NXM staked to ~1 million NXM is reached then the boost on yields would decrease to ~10%.

* The goal is to double staked NXM to approximately 1 million and grow TVL to over $500 million. Members are encouraged to discuss optimal reward structures to achieve these targets.

If members vote to accept Hugh’s proposal, the AB would be granted the authority to formalise this change and redirect RAMM Value to NXM Stakers.

Conclusion
DeFi is becoming much more acceptable throughout the world and is about to experience material inflows from traditional markets as the regulatory barriers come down. While Nexus Mutual is already very well positioned to take advantage of this, the proposed changes will make sure we capture as much growth as possible.
