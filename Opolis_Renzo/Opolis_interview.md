Insurance Industry Report - Transcript
00:00:00
 
Micah Baylor: Cool.
Kyle Jacobs: Okay. Yeah.
Micah Baylor: Yeah. I mean, I guess you could start like as like a insurance as a whole. Um, in in the insurance industry, the fastest growing segment of the insurance industry for the better part of the last decade, fact check that maybe. Um, has been captive insurance. And captive insurance is uh like a membersonly private insurance pool that can make custom insurance products for its members. It started with um it started with like ski lift insurance where you're required to have it. you're paying an extra $30 per person per day to your insurance company, but u you haven't had a claim since you opened your ski lift 30 years ago, you know. And um what they started doing is just saying like, "Hey, we're going to keep charging the $30, but we're going to put it into our own pool and then uh you can take dividends and profits out of that at the end of each uh policy year. And uh when the ACA happened uh in the health side, I mean captive insurance is growing all over the place.
 
 
00:01:23
 
Micah Baylor: Workers comp and everywhere, you know, uh maybe everywhere outside of like personal lines. I wouldn't say that you see it too often in like auto insurance yet. Um but you know, like all these things employers would be buying is typically where you see it. And uh when the ACA happened, a whole lot of employers started to go self-funded and they started to do captive insurance. It's grown, you know, 5 to 10% year-over-year every year for at least the last decade. Uh there's like 50 billion dollars uh right now in captive insurance whereas no one ever would have done anything with it, you know, 15 20 years ago. And um when you're when you're doing these pools, it's like you you can do whatever asset strategy you want. You can kind of hold whatever dollars you want. Uh I haven't really had a captive manager. When you start a captive, you go and you hire someone to do your compliance. And I haven't had a captive manager yet who's had a problem with stable coins, with crypto assets.
 
 
00:02:37
 
Micah Baylor: They're like, "Well, yeah, duh. You can do whatever you want as your funding mechanism." And if if that is the case, then I don't need to tell you about the efficiencies of stable coins and how that's that's trending. Um, the ability for normal people to make uh reinsurance instruments to tokenize bonds like in our case, like these things didn't exist before. So, you had this trend in the industry to do uh communityowned and then you have all the capital efficiencies in um in crypto that just make a whole lot of sense. And it's like, you know, uh insurance is so opaque that uh we we kind of get screwed on the back end constantly just because we know no better, right? Um, reinsurance in the health care market space is the one I can speak the most to. Um, it's it's normal to pay a 30% margin on your reinsurance like uh in inside of a health care premium. You know, you'll have $1,000 a month for a family, let's say. Um, and of that $1,000, two of the costs that are baked into it are two different types of reinsurance.
 
 
00:04:03
 
Micah Baylor: Um, one of them is specific uh specific event insurance.
Kyle Jacobs: Yes.
Micah Baylor: This is like an employer has said that they're going to self-fund and pay all of their claims, but um um you know if there's a singular awful event, someone needs a heart purchased for them and the cost is over whatever the employer's deductible is, they'll have a deductible on each person. Usually somewhere between like 35 to 100 grand per person. So, you get a $2 million claim in the the the spec the specific stop-loss insurance would kick in and you're paying a 30% margin on that hard cost uh that's baked into your premium. So, maybe it's uh $3 or $400 worth of $1,000 worth of premium and that cost is inflated by 30%. And uh likewise, you'll have another premium that's baked into that $1,000, and that's called aggregate stop-loss insurance. And aggregate isn't like a singular event. It's more like considering death by a thousand cuts over the course of the year. And you know, that one might be like $10.
 
 
00:05:20
 
Micah Baylor: It's going to be a lot less just because um dying by a thousand cuts over the course of the year happens only about 2% of the time. It really doesn't happen too often. But um either way, like you're going to pay like a 80 to 90% margin on your aggregate insurance and you're going to pay like a 30% margin on your spec stop-loss. And meanwhile, you can go and sell bonds and, you know, get a fat stack of yield just kind of baked into the base layer of a stable coin. And then you can stack what another 6% yield on top of it. So you just underwrite that into your premium. But because you know what your aggregate stop loss is going to be, you know where the bleeding would stop, right? So as a reinsurer, you just add a 6% yield to it. And you know if you go stack that on top of the yield that already exists in the blockchain uh bond investors are very happy to purchase you know a 12 to 30% yield and you can just beat the incumbent reinsurers super easily and there's a whole lot of liquidity in the blockchain right was uh the the first thing about becoming a riskbearing entity is having a ton of capital so that you can pay claims, you know.
 
 
00:06:58
 
Micah Baylor: Um, so there's a ton of capital in crypto. There's demand for things like this. Um, captives are in themselves entities. They're risk bearing entities. They hold assets. They pay claims, you know. Um, so I I think that like when you think about like what is an insurance company, an insurance company is really three things. It's it's a ton of money. It's a services provider that administers all of the contracts that say how you access the money. So like in the case of uh health insurance, you know, you'll have a stack of contracts. You'll have your network contract, your pharmacy agreement, um how you source all the drugs. I mean, it's if if you unbundled an insurance company, you would find that it's really just like dozens and dozens of contracts, a claims admin that knows how the contracts work, and that's how they do the um that's how they do the uh the underwriting, right? the actuary is because there's there's just one standard method that everyone uses for looking at say a census of employees with gender, zip code, date of birth and knowing like, hey, on average over the course of the last many decades, this gender, zip code, date of birth makeup has needed these things over the course of a year.
 
 
00:08:39
 
Micah Baylor: And by looking at their contracts, we know what those things are going to cost because you can see like the contracted rate for a heart attack or buying some aderall, you know, so you just know what your costs are. You know what how many of those instances you're going to need. Um you know how much money you've got in your pool. You decide if you can buy the risk. And that's like like fundamentally how it works. Um, so you know the capital efficiency allows for you to create more competitive premiums and people would like to pay less for insurance but have better benefits, you know, and I mean you can get you can get more affordable insurance just by using onchain funding methods. Um, but I I would say that, you know, and in the case of workers comp, you could probably win a lot of business just by reducing the hard cost of reinsurance. Um, because you have to be uh, you know, an incumbent carrier by not a lot of money on the workers's comp to get the employer to move the business.
 
 
00:09:54
 
Micah Baylor: and it's just like um it's more of a commodity. When it comes to health care, you typically have to beat their incumbent carrier by at least 15 to 20 points to get the employer to move. And that's just because it's more of a personal thing that scares the Jesus out of people. You know, when it comes to workers comp, they're like, "We don't really care if you're gonna get uh your arm fixed here or there, if you get stitches here or there." But when it's talking about health care, it's like, "Oh, are you going to cover my specific specialty medication? What happens if I get cancer and I can't go to whatever I perceive to be good?" The Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. Um, so you have to you have to beat the uh on the health care side, you know, a lot a lot more.
bryan colligan: Okay, we're dealing with some s*** this morning.
Micah Baylor: Um, yeah, I just saw his message.
bryan colligan: Apologize. Uh Ross will not be able to make it.
 
 
00:10:55
 
bryan colligan: Uh had a security issue.
Micah Baylor: That sucks. Um so you know when when you're looking at it's like one the funding method but then two it's about um just having different entities that have the ability to get big. Um, I think specifically I'm a big fan of the Colorado LCA and how that entity structure allows for token ownership and token governance, which means that you can start a community-owned health insurance that can get a ton of money in it. And being communityowned and your chief responsibility being to serve the token is completely different than the current shenanigans that happen in healthcare where a CEO's chief responsibility is to service a stock price because there's there's only so many Americans, you know, and every well everyone has insurance. A whole lot of people have insurance. there's not really like more people to sell to yearover-year. Yet, these CEOs, they have to grow their stock price. And there's legislation um that was really cemented during the ACA where we started to see this go haywire. Um medical expenses have been spinning out of cost.
 
 
00:12:34
 
Micah Baylor: Health insurance has been spinning out of control for like two decades. But the ACA really kicked it off. And that's because of legislation called the medical loss ratio, which limits insurers to only being allowed to make 15% profits. And if you're only allowed to make 15%. Then it takes away all incentive to make more efficient service models. So what you do is you hire more people. So you have more hard costs as a business and you make them run ridiculous prior authorization processes. You make it hard to get your drug approved and you make it so that you have to speak to 17 employees on awful service lines because they need those 17 employees to exist so that it costs more so that they can have a bigger pie to make 15% off of. And it only gets worse every single year because every year they only have to increase their stock dividend. So they only make the loops and the hoops you go and jump through more expensive and more cumbersome. So they can hire more nerds to sit around and administer these awful things.
 
 
00:13:57
 
Micah Baylor: And they'll never implement AI or technology in a meaningful way that lowers costs. you know um there it's wild if you go and you look at the number of administrators to physicians in the insurance space like in 1980 it was like one to one there was one administrator for every one physician and now in the health insurance space there is I mean there's like a hundred administrators it's it has gone crazy I I have a graph somewhere on my ex thread you could go find um the number of physicians really hasn't increased but the number of administrators has really just boomed. So, you know, I was speaking to funding method and these funding methods making it possible for these entity types like limited cooperative associations that are blockchain governed um to to really be like empowered to do what what is best. Because if you're serving a token instead of a stock price, then you know the token's value is derived differently than how a stock price, you know, value is derived, right? Uh my my chief value is to make people want to hold my token and they're the ones using my protocol.
 
 
00:15:21
 
Micah Baylor: So make it awesome, right?
Kyle Jacobs: That's um uh returning more value to stakeholders. that's like increased transparency for the strategies that are uh being used behind like to increase the yield on the capital that we're holding. Um I guess those are two things I'm trying to Yeah, I'm trying to understand.
Micah Baylor: are. So are those questions?
Kyle Jacobs: So like uh if I'm a token holder then I want um returns on the token which would be more uh value flowing to me through I guess like that would be replacement for dividend yield for me and then I want uh transparency also into how you're operating your sort of treasury the holdings that you have that are where your capital is there and it's put to work. it's available for servicing the need the the claims but it's uh more comfortable for my mind if I also know like where you're earning yield and what strategies you're using like which is that's transparency that's available because of uh blockchain as
Micah Baylor: 100%. Yeah. But transparent and trustlessness is a thing that is missing.
 
 
00:16:44
 
Micah Baylor: Like right now, people they're they hate it, but they're kind of fine paying some absurd premium to some label that they know because the industry's done a really good job of being super opaque. So, they're not aware of how bad they're being screwed.
Kyle Jacobs: Mhm.
Micah Baylor: And since everyone is screwing everyone, they just kind of like choose where they want to go get screwed. And it's not like I'm not going to make money. I'm going to charge fees and I'm going to put yield to bond holders, but a person can just go look and see like, oh, that's reasonable, you know. Um, absolutely. I think the transparent and trustlessness makes it so that people can purchase health care more like everything else that they've purchased. Right now, you just throw money in a dark pit and you have no clue how it works.
bryan colligan: So, so Micah, did do you get a context of like kind of what we're doing from the the top because it's it's a lot. I want to want to figure out how to like distilled it like where we want to give um maybe a talking point on like a slide like different categories of like insurance, right?
 
 
00:17:55
 
Micah Baylor: Mhm.
bryan colligan: That that where uh web 3 can help out. So, there's probably like a space to do that, but it would need to be like super distilled. It could be quote from you. Could quote That's kind of like why we're doing this quote from you. Uh potentially maybe a secondary quote from John on on the Opelis like like profile view.
Micah Baylor: Mhm.
bryan colligan: Um, and then our goal is to basically do like a research report blast and raise the amount of people because what we're finding is the amount of people in crypto that want to invest in insurance is very limited. So, we have to go to more Tradfi. So, if we want to go to Tradfi, we have to look Trady. So, I don't know if uh we've sent the report to you that the insure techch report of the company I used to work at, but we're going to do something a little bit like nicer than this, but um um yeah, cool.
Micah Baylor: You guys may have, but I haven't read it.
 
 
00:18:53
 
Micah Baylor: I didn't I didn't notice it. Um, but I'd be happy to check it out. Yeah. you know, I mean, maybe we're like getting in in the weeds, but if you're looking for like a high level, it's um more efficient funding methods. Um it's transparency. Uh at the beginning of this before you popped in, I talked about the growing trend of captive insurance in the insurance industry. Um, captive insurance is just like uh custom membersonly insurance products and um since it's membersonly uh regulators kind of let you do whatever asset strategy you want underneath it.
bryan colligan: Mhm.
Micah Baylor: Like I haven't had a captive manager tell me that my stable coins are not okay. You know, I've got loads of captives that are cool with working with me.
bryan colligan: Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean to be to be really straightforward, this is our hack. Um, we like are are you familiar with like Yieldfi? You're feel familiar with like Athena, of course, right?
Micah Baylor: Uh I mean not like in depth.
 
 
00:20:03
 
bryan colligan: Okay. So, Athena is like a yield bearing stable coin like with a like a basis trade underneath.
Micah Baylor: Yeah. Okay.
bryan colligan: Um the hack is that these these insurance capture right that's the word that you use correct insurance captives right so the capital that you have to have to maintain insurance what we're finding is is that it can stay
Micah Baylor: Insurance captives. Yep.
bryan colligan: in a yield varying stable coin as well and that's really like the the big unlock and the play.
Micah Baylor: Yep. Yep.
bryan colligan: Yeah.
Micah Baylor: Because you you only have to add so much yield.
bryan colligan: So that that's Yeah.
Micah Baylor: You used to have to get your full 30% margin from the insurance premium. But now you can get half of it from the stable coin and then you can get some of it from premium still.
bryan colligan: Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. That's that's alpha growth play is like how do we set up those vaults and how do we set up those structures for the entire insurance industry.
 
 
00:20:58
 
Micah Baylor: Yeah. Yep. Well, you know, it's like it's like yeah, the capital side is one side, but then like these ownership structures where the chief duty is to service the member owner, it makes it so that the contracts that you build
bryan colligan: Yeah.
Micah Baylor: into your network, they also have a lot of the commissions and rebates and kickbacks removed from them because my my chief duty now isn't to, you know, um It's it's not to s service like some stock
bryan colligan: Perfect.
Micah Baylor: price, you know, it's to keep my token holders happy.
bryan colligan: Yeah.
Micah Baylor: So, I do that by making their drugs no cost instead of 10x the price, you know, right?
bryan colligan: Right. So, so you you you get it back to the token holders, you get it back to the like like the co-op, the group versus like, oh, I'm I'm have these like regulatory confines and so it'll be more profitable and better insurance and maybe even more coverage and they cover more things and reduce costs and it'll just be more capital efficient because over the long enough time of Verizon um that is where the the line trends and
 
 
00:22:04
 
Micah Baylor: Yep. Yep. I mean, right now right now I'm watching I'm watching uh I'm watching folks get increases.
bryan colligan: so Yes.
Micah Baylor: So, like their incumbent carrier is coming back and telling them, "Hey, we're going to give you a 20 something percent 30 something percent increase going into next year and they still have a $6,000 deductible. They still have out of network. They're limited on where they can go and they have to pay six grand to go where they're allowed to go." And
bryan colligan: Yeah.
Micah Baylor: I'll go in and I'll quote the same case and I'll say, "Hey, no increase. I got you a 4% decrease on this year. So like it's going down, not up. And every doctor is in network and no co-pays, no deductibles.
bryan colligan: Yeah.
Micah Baylor: And it's just because of the ownership structure. I'm not a corporation with all of this um bloat and administrative costs that I have to keep because I'm only allowed to make 15% profits, you know, like I'm a I'm a I I'm going to use AI and
 
 
00:23:09
 
bryan colligan: Heat. Yeah, super cool.
Micah Baylor: technology instead of making up a bunch of hard costs. Um, super dope.
bryan colligan: All right. And All right, Kyle, we need to we need to leverage this recording. This is so cool. Um anything else um that where blockchain comes into like insurance that you also think is like so corporate structure right um I'm hearing that I'm hearing corporate structure I'm hearing organizational kind of structure recapture anything
Micah Baylor: Um, you know, I I said earlier in this like an insurance company is really just three things. It's a a stack of contracts that say how you can access your benefits and inside of those contracts is the cost of every benefit you could get and any kickback commission or something associated with that benefit. And it's like when when you make a community-owned insurance, all of those contracts have all the evil taken out of them. Um, when you go and hire a claims administrator to administer those contracts, you use technology instead of unnecessary human labor.
bryan colligan: Yeah, dude.
 
 
00:24:34
 
Micah Baylor: It's it's enhancing the three different points. It's enhancing the contracts, the claims administration, and the capital efficiency. And like every insurance is just those three things, you know?
bryan colligan: This is gold.
Micah Baylor: So much fun.
bryan colligan: Well, let's uh let's get you out there, right? We'll get you out there and and and chitchatting about this and we're we're going to get this in before.
Micah Baylor: Yeah.
bryan colligan: Do you want to be as your own independent thing or do you want to be under Oops.
Micah Baylor: No, I'm Oops. At the end of the day, you know, I think that someone Kyle said earlier, why Oopoulos?
bryan colligan: Cool.
Micah Baylor: Uh the incumbent carriers have done a really damn good job of making it impossible legislatively to uh start an insurance company. Uh there's this whole thing between um legal multiple employer welfare uh welfare associations and illegal welfare associations. Um you have to have like hundreds of millions of dollars to start just a public insurance company. The eas thing to do is to start a membersonly insurance company.
 
 
00:25:38
 
bryan colligan: Yeah, I'm literally talking to like a like a mortgage insurance person about this. All right, here's here's what I'm going to do. I got to go start working on the security thing. Like Ross is calling me.
Micah Baylor: Yep.
bryan colligan: I'm going to bounce on that.
Micah Baylor: Yep. Cool. Cool. Um, sweet. Do you want me to Yeah, sweet. Kyle, are you heading out? Are you got a hard stop?
Kyle Jacobs: Um, I need Well, I don't have to be anywhere quite yet. And I have one more question.
Micah Baylor: Cool. I I I just want to say like the whyopouloolis bit.
Kyle Jacobs: It's Yeah.
Micah Baylor: OPOS is an established association on the blockchain and there's like not a lot of those and associations um the like like the legislative requirement for having a membersonly insurance company is you have to have something that you're doing together and then you can manage your shared risks. Like it would be illegal for me to just go out and be like, "Hey, anyone can become a member of my architecture association unless they're architects and they have that shared association and we're managing our shared risks as architects." And
 
 
00:27:04
 
Kyle Jacobs: No heat.
Micah Baylor: uh when you look at Oops, it's like the only blockchain association. And since anyone can use blockchain, it's like this hack, you know, it's like the internet association. And you you have to have had an association together for a period of time for regulators to recognize that as legitimate.
Kyle Jacobs: Two.
Micah Baylor: Like there there's some states where you have to have had an association for like the last 10 years or you have to have had done it even before a date and time in the sand and it's not even possible to start one today. and Opouls has, you know, we we've been out here fighting the good fight, but now we've had an association of bringing blockchain people together for long enough that the regulators will let us manage our shared risks together and that that's it's the only place I know that we could do this, you know, at least in the model we're doing it in the health care space. Uh, what's your other question?
Kyle Jacobs: Uh I wondered if you could give me some uh preparation insight into your relationship with uh Renzo.
 
 
00:28:23
 
Kyle Jacobs: I've spoken with uh like Lucas briefly. I know they have these flow vaults and the flow vaults you can set like conditions uh for when funding is paid out and maybe where the where the money goes and what it does.
Micah Baylor: Mhm.
Kyle Jacobs: Uh I was wondering if you had any more clarity that you could provide on that or what's like from your perspective something like that.
Micah Baylor: Yeah, you know, like um Renzo is really like our stop-loss protocol. They're like our reinsurance protocol.
Kyle Jacobs: Mhm.
Micah Baylor: And reinsurance is really messed up. like uh you all all insurance is about buying something that you hope you never use. That's been kind of clouded on the on the health care side because people are buying it kind of expecting to use it some um you know preventative services for example. It's kind of like a membership with some insurance on top. Uh, but insurance is supposed to be a thing you pay into that you hope you never use. You're supposed to just be buying peace of mind.
 
 
00:29:37
 
Micah Baylor: And reinsurance companies, they really want you to never use it. And they write their contracts in ways that are super like you got to be careful or they just may legally be able to deny your claim. Um like like for example with medical billing, you oftentimes get your medical bills 60 days after the fact. Like by the time they've been processed and the hospital actually sent it and we negotiated it and we priced it, like it's going to take like 60 days to pay a medical bill in like a PO or HMO network. And a reinsurer will say, "Hey, Mr. employer who's self-funded, you have to pay all of your claims before the end of the year, even though we know you're probably going to get a fat stack of claims in January and February. And um there's these little spots where employers who are not watching carefully, they they get screwed, you know, like I I always sit around at the end of December and I just pay claims. Like just sit there on a fat stack of Oops reserves and just flush out claims that normally would have taken another month maybe to process.
 
 
00:31:04
 
Micah Baylor: And um my reinsurers don't always like this. if I'm over expected spend, you know, um and they this is a spot normally where you would see a reinsurer try to delay payment or deny your claim even though you followed the guidelines of the policy. And like it's it's really dangerous for an employer to have a a reinsurance contract. And if you look at the efficiencies of a smart contract, a smart contract is just like paid claim, execute reimbursement, you know, and uh that's that's what you need to see. It's not like the money is not there. They're building in 30 to 60 90% margins depending on what type of stop-loss insurance it is. And um you know this process of selling bonds and backstopping it with employer premiums is making it so that you have the capital that smart contracts can manage and smart contracts are just good. You know um I mean it's it's huge. uh an insurance company is going to deny and delay a claim if they're not getting reimbursed by their reinsurer, right?
 
 
00:32:28
 
Micah Baylor: It's like it's like compounded deny delaying. Like you're getting your little thing denied delayed because they're getting denied delayed over here and it's like why did it take six months for me to get my heart surgery scheduled, right? It's like, oh, compounded, deny, delay. And if you take out half of that with just not having the reinsurance be god awful, and then you have network contracts and and AI that's running the administration of those network contracts, right? And those things are benevolent, then your heart surgery doesn't take six months to book. It's like, you need heart surgery. Cool. How does next week sound? Right? And I mean, that's like real stuff. That's people living or dying, you know? So, yeah. I don't know. What does Renzo do? It's it's some boring bond stuff, but those bonds being having access to um, you know, a distributed network of humans who can fund the the financial model. It makes it so that we don't have to go get in bed with Godzilla.
 
 
00:33:43
 
Kyle Jacobs: Mhm.
Micah Baylor: to get access to the capital that we need. And then those funds being manages managed by smart contracts completely changes the human experience on the ground level um profoundly. So does that answer your question or is that too esoterical?
Kyle Jacobs: No. Uh, it's great and um I'll talk with Renzo more about like uh how I don't know the boring stuff like how it works, what their contracts are, what they're doing, etc. But you've got an inspirational approach towards communicating while also being very um distilled or like ELI5. And so I will be relisting to this and looking at the transcripts and like understanding what all the stuff means a bit more. But um if I were to repeat back to you what I think you're saying, it's like there are a bunch of efficiencies um more yield, better transparency, more um less hassle, more uh like less bloat, uh less excessive margins due to opaqueness, which I then pass on to my shareholders who are then happier and more getting their needs met uh quickly. no matter if they're large needs or small needs, that makes them more committed to me.
 
 
00:35:06
 
Kyle Jacobs: And then because I'm running a private organization for this, I don't have the 15% cap on my profits, which means if I'm able to successfully build um a tribe that is pleased with me and is continuing to give me money and continuing to like participate, then my profits and their welfare can grow as well as the effectiveness of the insurance that we're providing.
Micah Baylor: You know, you still have the 15% cap.
Kyle Jacobs: Oh.
Micah Baylor: It's just that that's not the only way that you make money. you also make money through um token price go up, you know, and if you do have money left over, then you're going to pay it out as as dividend and that also makes token price go up, but like
Kyle Jacobs: Mhm.
Micah Baylor: the organization can still only retain 15%. It's just that the the extra money is going to pump token price and Yeah.
Kyle Jacobs: That's awesome.
Micah Baylor: Token price pumps what? 10x to the value that it holds.
Kyle Jacobs: and along with the other markets and stuff. And then that means that you have an alpha growth that's coming in and saying like uh how can we help manage your treasury so that you profit from the volatility of token price like which the other companies they don't have that uh sort of like hedge fund integration thing that like is implicit with all the blockchain stuff.
Micah Baylor: Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah, I really like the way articulated it back to me.
Kyle Jacobs: Cool.
Micah Baylor: That's the only clarification they have. I think that that's a really good distilled version of my 40minute rant.
Kyle Jacobs: Cool.
Micah Baylor: Spot on. Cool, sir. Love the work you guys are doing always. You mentioned a new alpha growth website. I checked. It's not up yet. When is it coming?
Kyle Jacobs: Uh maybe a couple weeks.
