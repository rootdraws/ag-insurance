[slide 2] Overview, explanation of what's happening with Insurance and Crypto
[KYLE]


[Title 1] Why are there so many insurance companies coming to crypto


content to answer with - shorten & condense.
 So, we do a little bit of the financing, a little bit of the category. Like, what is it? Um...  Yeah. You know, nascent capital, regulatory arbitrage, like crypto is more capital efficient than the current capital markets around insurance.  We can start to re-utilize and re-hypothecate cash accounts into more utilized leverage on short-term credit because the cost of getting in and out of short-term credit execution in crypto is a lot more capital efficient.  It doesn't cost 90 to 100 days to get into a T-bill and out to a T-bill. Execution costs literally a week to get in and out.  And it's not days to get your capital back. It's literally hours. So you can get in and out in minutes instead of days.  And the cost of execution is days instead of months to get in and out of short-term credit products. That's the efficiency.  And the insurance providers are starting to see this. And the ones that don't do this will lag. But everybody.  Everybody in the insurance industry will start to move this direction as like the overarching narrative. So we have to like be careful to make claims and legal claims and like that.  We don't want to do that. We just want to like inform like why now I would lead with that.  You know, why is there so many insurance products coming to crypto, capital efficiency, short-term credit products, nascent capital not getting as much juice as it can and yield as it can.  And DeFi yields are surpassed traditional yields. If you can manage the risk. And then do we need to mention something about tax liquidity?
